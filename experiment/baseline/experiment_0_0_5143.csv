"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) compliance.

However, Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) of the Agreement mentions that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This implies that the financial entity is responsible for complying with relevant laws and regulations, including DORA obligations, but it does not specifically mention DORA.

Furthermore, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This suggests that outsourcing does not diminish Atlassian's responsibility, but it does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains responsibility for DORA compliance.

Therefore, while the Agreement implies that the financial entity is responsible for complying with relevant laws and regulations, including DORA obligations, it does not explicitly state that they retain full responsibility for DORA compliance."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:
 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","**Compliance Review: Financial Entity's Retained Responsibility for Financial Services Laws**

After reviewing the contract, it is clear that Atlassian, the financial entity, has a retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. The contract comprehensively covers various regulations, including tax laws, export restrictions, and data protection laws. However, there are a few areas where the contract could be improved to ensure clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations.

The contract does not explicitly state that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers or subcontractors. While the contract mentions that Atlassian will use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations, it does not clearly state that Atlassian will retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws.

Furthermore, the contract does not explicitly acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations beyond the term of the agreement. While the contract mentions that Atlassian will comply with all applicable laws, it does not clearly state that this obligation will continue beyond the termination of the agreement.

To address these gaps, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the contract that covers the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should:

* Clearly state that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers or subcontractors
* Acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations beyond the term of the agreement
* Reference specific financial services laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules

Example of the recommended clause:

""19.1 Retention of Regulatory Responsibilities. Atlassian acknowledges and agrees that it will retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws, including but not limited to, tax laws, export restrictions, and data protection laws. Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers or subcontractors, and will ensure that all subcontractors and affiliates comply with all applicable financial services laws. Atlassian's ongoing regulatory obligations will continue beyond the term of this agreement, and Atlassian will comply with all applicable financial services laws, including but not limited to, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules.""

By adding this clause, the contract will provide clear and comprehensive coverage of Atlassian's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and minimizing potential risks."

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as gap and recommend adding comprehensive criticality assessment framework.","Compliance Review: Criticality Assessment Methodology

A comprehensive criticality assessment methodology is essential to evaluate the importance and potential impact of services, processes, or functions within an organization. This review aims to identify the criteria, classification levels, impact thresholds, and review requirements for assessing criticality.

The following criticality assessment criteria are commonly used:

* **Business Impact**: The potential financial, operational, or reputational impact on the organization if the service, process, or function is unavailable or compromised.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: The level of regulatory requirements and compliance obligations associated with the service, process, or function.
* **Customer Impact**: The potential impact on customers if the service, process, or function is unavailable or compromised.
* **Operational Dependency**: The level of dependency on the service, process, or function to support critical business operations.

Classification levels for criticality assessments typically include:

* **High**: Critical services, processes, or functions that have a significant business impact, high regulatory compliance requirements, or a high level of customer dependency.
* **Medium**: Services, processes, or functions that have a moderate business impact, moderate regulatory compliance requirements, or a moderate level of customer dependency.
* **Low**: Services, processes, or functions that have a minimal business impact, low regulatory compliance requirements, or a low level of customer dependency.

Impact thresholds are used to determine the level of criticality based on the assessment criteria. For example:

* **High Impact**: Services, processes, or functions that have a potential financial impact of $100,000 or more, or a potential reputational impact of 10% or more.
* **Medium Impact**: Services, processes, or functions that have a potential financial impact of $10,000 to $99,999, or a potential reputational impact of 1% to 9%.

Review requirements for criticality assessments typically include:

* **Regular Reviews**: Criticality assessments should be reviewed at least annually to ensure that the classification levels and impact thresholds remain accurate.
* **Change Management**: Criticality assessments should be updated whenever there are significant changes to the service, process, or function, or when there are changes to regulatory requirements or customer dependencies.

If a comprehensive criticality assessment framework is missing, it is recommended to flag this as a gap and implement a framework that includes the above criteria, classification levels, impact thresholds, and review requirements. This will ensure that critical services, processes, or functions are properly identified and prioritized for risk mitigation and resource allocation."

"Search for provisions allowing regulatory body inspections. Look for:
 • Access scope
 • Notice requirements
 • Cooperation obligations
 • Documentation requirements
 • Information sharing protocols
 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit regulatory inspection rights.","Compliance finding: Provisions allowing regulatory body inspections are scattered throughout the Atlassian Customer Agreement, but they do not provide a comprehensive framework for regulatory inspections.

The agreement mentions that Atlassian may provide access to Customer Data to regulatory bodies, such as government authorities, in Section 4.2 (Security Program), which states that Atlassian will maintain an information security program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications. However, this provision does not explicitly grant regulatory bodies the right to inspect Atlassian's premises or facilities.

In Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination), the agreement states that Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation, but it does not specify what documentation is required to be provided to regulatory bodies in the event of an inspection.

Furthermore, the agreement does not provide clear notice requirements for regulatory body inspections, cooperation obligations, or information sharing protocols.

Recommendation: To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, I recommend adding explicit provisions that grant regulatory bodies the right to inspect Atlassian's premises, facilities, and documentation, as well as clear notice requirements, cooperation obligations, and information sharing protocols.

Specifically, the following provisions should be added:

* A clause that grants regulatory bodies the right to inspect Atlassian's premises and facilities, including data centers and other facilities where Customer Data is stored or processed.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide notice to Customer in the event of a regulatory inspection, including the name and contact information of the regulatory body, the purpose and scope of the inspection, and the expected duration of the inspection.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to cooperate with regulatory bodies during inspections, including providing access to documentation, personnel, and facilities as requested.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide regulatory bodies with information and documentation as requested, including Customer Data and other relevant information.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to maintain records of regulatory inspections, including the date, time, and duration of the inspection, the name and contact information of the regulatory body, and the information and documentation provided to the regulatory body.

By adding these provisions, Atlassian can ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and provide a clear framework for regulatory inspections."

The review of BCDR plans reveals several gaps and areas for improvement. Firstly, the plan components are incomplete, lacking essential elements such as incident management, crisis communication, and business impact analysis. Furthermore, the plans do not adequately align with operational needs, as they fail to account for critical business processes and dependencies.

**Plan Components:**

* Missing: Incident management procedures
* Missing: Crisis communication protocols
* Missing: Business impact analysis
* Missing: Recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs)

**Alignment with Operational Needs:**

* The plans do not account for critical business processes and dependencies
* The plans do not identify key stakeholders and their roles in BCDR

**Update Frequency:**

* The plans are not updated regularly, with some plans not having been reviewed in over 12 months
* The update process is not documented, and changes are not communicated to stakeholders

**Testing Requirements:**

* The plans do not specify testing frequencies or procedures
* The plans do not identify testing metrics or success criteria

**Documentation Standards:**

* The plans are not standardized, with varying formats and levels of detail
* The plans do not include version control or change management procedures

**Resilience Gap:**

The lack of comprehensive BCDR requirements and inadequate plan components, alignment, update frequency, testing requirements, and documentation standards pose a significant resilience gap. To address this gap, I recommend adding the following requirements:

* Conduct a business impact analysis to identify critical business processes and dependencies

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend implementing structured incident response framework.","**Incident Response Plan Specifications: Compliance Requirement**

As a compliance officer, it is essential to ensure that the organization has a well-defined incident response plan in place to mitigate the impact of security incidents. The plan should include specific procedures for responding to incidents, such as identifying and containing the incident, notifying stakeholders, and escalating the issue to the relevant teams. The plan should also outline the timelines for notification, including the time it takes to notify affected parties, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders. Additionally, the plan should specify the escalation protocols, including the roles and responsibilities of each team member and the communication channels to be used. Furthermore, the plan should require documentation of all incident-related activities, including the root cause analysis, containment and eradication efforts, and post-incident activities. Effective communication is also crucial, and the plan should outline the communication plans for stakeholders, including the information to be shared, the channels to be used, and the frequency of updates."

* Improvement procedures: There are no procedures in place to address test results, making it challenging to implement corrective actions and improve controls and procedures.

Flag as testing gap: The organization should flag this as a testing gap and prioritize adding comprehensive testing requirements to ensure the effectiveness of its controls and procedures.

Suggested Solution: Develop a comprehensive testing plan that includes:

* Clearly defined test types and frequency requirements
* Standardized documentation templates for test results
* A process for reporting test results and tracking corrective actions
* Procedures for implementing improvements based on test results

This will ensure that the organization has a robust testing program in place to identify and address potential control weaknesses, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of its controls and procedures."
"Search for clear termination provisions. Look for:
 • Termination triggers
 • Notice requirements
 • Material breach definitions
 • Non-compliance criteria
 • Process requirements
 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding detailed termination provisions.","**Termination Provisions Review**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the termination provisions as follows:

The Agreement allows for termination by either party under the following circumstances:

* Termination for Convenience: Customer may terminate the Agreement or a Subscription Term upon notice for any reason, subject to Section 10.3 (Return Policy), which requires a 30-day notice period and does not entitle Customer to any refunds.
* Termination for Cause: Either party may terminate the Agreement or a Subscription Term if the other party: (a) fails to cure a material breach of the Agreement within 30 days after notice, (b) ceases operation without a successor, or (c) seeks protection under a bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors' arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if such a proceeding is instituted against that party and not dismissed within 60 days.
* Effect of Termination: Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement or a Subscription Term, Customer's rights to use the applicable Products, Support, or Advisory Services will cease, and Customer must immediately cease accessing the Cloud Products and using the applicable Software Products and Cloud Clients.

However, I have identified some areas where the termination provisions could be improved:

* The Agreement lacks clear definitions for ""material breach"" and ""non-compliance criteria,"" which could lead to ambiguity and disputes in the event of a termination.
* The notice requirements for termination are not explicitly stated, and the 30-day notice period mentioned in Section 10.3 (Return Policy) may not be applicable to all termination scenarios.
* The Agreement does not specify the process requirements for termination, such as the steps to be taken by the terminating party or the procedures for handling customer data and equipment.

**Recommendation**

To improve the termination provisions, I recommend adding the following details:

* Define ""material breach"" and ""non-compliance criteria"" to provide clarity on the grounds for termination.
* Specify the notice requirements for termination, including the format, content, and timing of the notice.
* Outline the process requirements for termination, including the steps to be taken by the terminating party, the procedures for handling customer data and equipment, and any other relevant details.
* Consider adding a provision for a ""cure period"" to allow the non-terminating party to rectify any material breaches or non-compliance before termination takes effect.

By adding these details, the termination provisions will be more comprehensive and easier to understand, reducing the risk of disputes and ensuring a smoother termination process."
