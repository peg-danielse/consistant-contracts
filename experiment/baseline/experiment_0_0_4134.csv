After reviewing the contract, it appears that Atlassian, the financial entity, has made clear statements regarding its retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. However, there are some areas that require further attention to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**Comprehensive Coverage of All Applicable Regulations**

The contract mentions compliance with ""all Laws applicable to its business"" (Section 20.1), which includes financial services laws. However, it does not explicitly list all applicable financial services regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.

**Non-Delegation of Regulatory Responsibilities**

The contract does not explicitly state that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to third parties. This is a critical aspect of compliance, as financial entities must ensure that they maintain control over regulatory obligations.

**Clear Acknowledgment of Ongoing Regulatory Obligations**

The contract mentions that Atlassian must comply with Laws applicable to its business (Section 20.1), but it does not explicitly acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations. This is essential to ensure that Atlassian continues to meet its regulatory requirements over time.

**References to Specific Financial Services Laws**

The contract does not reference specific financial services laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) or the USA PATRIOT Act. This omission may indicate a lack of awareness or understanding of the specific regulatory requirements applicable to Atlassian's business.

**Recommendation**

To address these gaps, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the contract that covers the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should:

1. List all applicable financial services regulations, including AML and KYC requirements.

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit regulatory inspection rights.","**Compliance Observation: Regulatory Body Inspections**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address regulatory body inspections, which may be a concern for customers handling sensitive data or operating in highly regulated industries. Upon reviewing the agreement, I found no provisions that specifically allow or require regulatory body inspections, including access scope, notice requirements, cooperation obligations, documentation requirements, or information sharing protocols.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Access Scope:** There is no clear provision outlining the scope of access that regulatory bodies may have during an inspection.
2. **Notice Requirements:** The agreement does not specify the notice requirements for regulatory bodies to inspect Atlassian's premises, systems, or data.
3. **Cooperation Obligations:** There is no explicit provision requiring Atlassian to cooperate with regulatory bodies during an inspection.
4. **Documentation Requirements:** The agreement does not specify the documentation requirements for regulatory bodies to access or review during an inspection.
5. **Information Sharing Protocols:** There is no clear protocol for Atlassian to share information with regulatory bodies during an inspection.

**Recommendation:**

To address these concerns, I recommend adding explicit regulatory inspection rights to the Atlassian Customer Agreement. This can include provisions that:

* Specify the scope of access for regulatory bodies during an inspection
* Outline the notice requirements for regulatory bodies to inspect Atlassian's premises, systems, or data
* Require Atlassian to cooperate with regulatory bodies during an inspection
* Specify the documentation requirements for regulatory bodies to access or review during an inspection
* Establish clear information sharing protocols for regulatory bodies during an inspection

This will provide customers with greater transparency and assurance that Atlassian is committed to complying with regulatory requirements and cooperating with regulatory bodies during inspections."

Upon reviewing the requirements for regular testing of controls and procedures, it is clear that there is a need for more comprehensive testing to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls. The current requirements are insufficient, and I recommend adding comprehensive testing requirements to address the following gaps:

**Test Types:** The current requirements only specify testing of financial transactions and accounts, but do not cover other critical areas such as IT, operational, and compliance controls. I suggest adding testing of all critical controls, including IT, operational, and compliance controls.

**Frequency Requirements:** The current requirements specify testing on a quarterly and annual basis, but do not provide clear guidance on the frequency of testing for all controls. I recommend establishing a clear testing frequency for all controls, including quarterly, semi-annual, and annual testing.

**Documentation Standards:** The current requirements do not provide clear guidance on documentation standards for testing results and control deficiencies. I suggest establishing clear documentation standards, including the use of templates and reporting formats, to ensure consistency and accuracy.

**Result Reporting:** The current requirements do not specify the format or content of testing result reports. I recommend establishing clear guidelines for reporting testing results, including the identification of control deficiencies, recommendations for improvement, and tracking of corrective actions.

**Improvement Procedures:** The current requirements do not specify procedures for addressing control deficiencies and improving controls. I suggest establishing clear procedures for addressing control deficiencies, including the identification of root causes, development of corrective action plans, and tracking of implementation progress.

**Flagging Testing Gaps:** I flag the current testing requirements as a testing gap and recommend adding comprehensive testing requirements to address the identified gaps.

**Recommendation:** I suggest adding comprehensive testing requirements to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls. This includes:

* Establishing clear testing frequencies for all controls
* Specifying documentation standards for testing results and control deficiencies
* Developing clear guidelines for reporting testing results
* Establishing procedures for addressing control deficiencies and improving controls

By implementing these recommendations, the organization can ensure that its internal controls are effective, efficient, and compliant with regulatory requirements."

The notice requirements are specified in Section 20.5, which states that notices under this Agreement must be in writing and are deemed given on the date of personal delivery, receipt by a recognized overnight courier, or the third business day after mailing. However, the agreement does not specify the exact content or format of the notice.

The process requirements are outlined in Section 12.4, which states that upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or a Subscription Term, Customer's rights to use the applicable Products, Support or Advisory Services will cease, and Customer must immediately cease accessing the Cloud Products and using the applicable Software Products and Cloud Clients.

To improve the compliance of the agreement, I recommend adding detailed termination provisions, including:

* A clear definition of material breach and non-compliance criteria
* Specific notice requirements, including the content and format of the notice
* A detailed process for termination, including the steps to be taken by each party
* A timeline for termination, including the date by which the notice must be given and the date by which the termination will take effect
