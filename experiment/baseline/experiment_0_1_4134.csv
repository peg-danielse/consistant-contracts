"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","**Compliance Statement:** The contract reviewed does not explicitly address the assessment of the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider.

Upon reviewing the contract, I found no clauses that specifically discuss the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. The contract does mention the customer's responsibility to determine whether the products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use (Section 6.2), but it does not address the substitutability of the provider.

**Gap:** The contract lacks provisions for assessing the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. This gap may lead to difficulties in evaluating the risks associated with relying on a specific provider and may hinder the customer's ability to switch to an alternative provider if needed.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend that the contract include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider. This could involve defining criteria for determining substitutability, such as:

* The provider's level of dependence on proprietary technology or intellectual property
* The ease of transitioning to a new provider
* The availability of alternative providers with similar capabilities
* The potential impact on business operations and continuity

By including these provisions, the contract can ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the substitutability of the provider and can make informed decisions about their reliance on the provider."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that specific criteria for determining substitutability are not clearly defined. While the contract mentions the need for Customer to ensure that Atlassian's Products meet its requirements and regulatory obligations (Section 6.2), it does not provide explicit guidelines for evaluating substitutability.

To address this gap, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

1. Cost: A clear definition of the costs associated with switching to an alternative product, including any potential savings or additional expenses.
2. Technical specifications: A detailed comparison of the technical specifications of the current product and the proposed substitute, including compatibility, scalability, and performance.
3. Ease of transition: A assessment of the complexity and time required to transition from the current product to the proposed substitute, including any potential disruptions to business operations.

Industry standards for substitutability assessments may include:

* The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework for evaluating software development and maintenance processes
* The ISO/IEC 9126 standard for software quality evaluation
* The Gartner Magic Quadrant for evaluating software products and vendors

By incorporating these criteria and industry standards, the contract can provide a more comprehensive framework for evaluating substitutability and ensuring that Customer's needs are met."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","After reviewing the contract, I have identified the following clauses related to documentation of alternative providers in the market:

* Section 7.2, Third-Party Products, states that ""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products"").""
* Section 7.2 also mentions that ""Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement.""

However, there is no explicit requirement to document or maintain a list of alternative providers in the market. The contract does not mention any obligation for the customer to research or identify alternative providers.

To address this gap, I recommend including a clause that mandates regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This clause could be added to Section 7.2, Third-Party Products, and would look something like this:

""7.2.1. Market Scan. Customer agrees to conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers of Third-Party Products that are compatible with the Products. The list of alternative providers shall be maintained and updated by Customer on a quarterly basis and shall be made available to Atlassian upon request.""

This clause would require the customer to:

* Conduct regular market scans to identify alternative providers
* Document the list of alternative providers
* Maintain and update the list on a quarterly basis
* Make the list available to Atlassian upon request

By including this clause, the contract would ensure that the customer is actively researching and documenting alternative providers in the market, which would help to ensure compliance with any applicable laws or regulations."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks a provision requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers, which is a critical aspect of maintaining strategic flexibility and ensuring optimal resource allocation.

Upon reviewing the agreement, I did not find any specific requirements for conducting a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. However, Section 20.5 (Changes to this Agreement) suggests that Atlassian may modify the agreement from time to time, which could potentially impact the customer's business operations and strategy. 

To address this compliance gap, I recommend adding a provision that requires customers to conduct regular cost-benefit analyses of alternative providers to ensure they are making informed decisions about their business operations and resource allocation. This analysis should consider financial, operational, and strategic factors, including:

* Financial factors: costs, pricing, and return on investment
* Operational factors: compatibility, scalability, and integration with existing systems
* Strategic factors: alignment with business objectives, innovation, and future-proofing

By incorporating this provision, customers can ensure they are maintaining strategic flexibility and making informed decisions about their business operations, which is essential for long-term success."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks explicit provisions requiring customers to maintain awareness of market alternatives, despite the importance of staying informed about emerging competitors and innovative solutions.

**Extracted Provision:** None.

**Validation:** The agreement does not contain any clauses that explicitly require customers to conduct periodic market research or maintain awareness of market alternatives. This is a significant gap, as staying informed about emerging competitors and innovative solutions can help customers make informed decisions about their use of Atlassian's products and services.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. This can be achieved by incorporating the following language into the agreement:

""Customer acknowledges the importance of staying informed about market alternatives and agrees to conduct periodic market research to evaluate emerging competitors and innovative solutions. Customer will maintain awareness of market trends and developments that may impact its use of Atlassian's products and services.""

This provision will help ensure that customers remain informed about market alternatives and are better equipped to make informed decisions about their use of Atlassian's products and services."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","**Compliance Requirement:** The contract requires Customer to assess existing arrangements with Atlassian to ensure compliance with the terms of the new agreement.

**Specific Requirements:**

* Section 5.2 of the contract states that Customer must confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use upon Atlassian's written request.
* Section 5.2 also allows Atlassian or its authorized agents to audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.

**Gaps:**

* The contract does not explicitly require Customer to review or assess the number, type, and scope of existing arrangements with Atlassian.
* The contract only requires a one-time confirmation of compliance with the applicable Scope of Use, and does not specify the need for periodic reviews of existing arrangements.

**Recommendation:** To ensure ongoing compliance, it is recommended that Customer include periodic reviews of all existing contracts with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements, to ensure that they remain compliant with the terms of the new agreement. This can be achieved by:

* Scheduling regular reviews of existing contracts with Atlassian, such as annually or bi-annually.
* Conducting a thorough assessment of the number, type, and scope of existing arrangements with Atlassian.
* Ensuring that all existing arrangements are compliant with the terms of the new agreement.
* Making any necessary adjustments or amendments to existing arrangements to ensure compliance.

By including periodic reviews of existing contracts with Atlassian, Customer can ensure ongoing compliance with the terms of the new agreement and avoid any potential gaps or issues."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Compliance requirement identified: Provisions requiring assessment of relationships with closely connected providers are missing in the contract.

The contract does not explicitly require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers, such as third-party vendors, subcontractors, or affiliates. However, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, but it does not require Customer to evaluate the risks associated with these relationships.

To address this compliance requirement, I suggest including provisions in the contract that require Customer to evaluate and document the risks associated with closely connected providers. This could include:

* Requiring Customer to conduct regular risk assessments of its relationships with closely connected providers
* Requiring Customer to maintain documentation of its risk assessments and mitigation strategies
* Requiring Customer to notify Atlassian of any changes to its relationships with closely connected providers
* Requiring Atlassian to provide Customer with information about its subcontractors and affiliates, including their roles and responsibilities

By including these provisions, the contract can ensure that Customer is aware of and takes steps to manage the risks associated with closely connected providers, which can help to mitigate potential compliance risks and ensure the integrity of the agreement."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","After reviewing the contract, I have identified the following clauses that relate to the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services:

* Section 20.13, ""Export Restrictions"", mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. However, this clause does not directly address concentration risk.
* Section 20.11, ""Subcontractors and Affiliates"", states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, this clause does not require tracking dependency on the provider.

The contract does not explicitly require tracking dependency on the provider or evaluating concentration risk. However, Section 20.11 implies that Atlassian may use multiple subcontractors or Affiliates, which could potentially create concentration risk.

To address this, I recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks. This could be included in the contract under a new clause, such as:

""20.14 Concentration Risk Management

* Atlassian acknowledges that Customer may rely on multiple services provided by Atlassian, which may create concentration risk.
* Atlassian shall maintain a record of all services provided to Customer, including the number of services and the level of dependency on each service.
* Atlassian shall identify and mitigate any concentration risks that may arise from its provision of multiple services to Customer.
* Atlassian shall provide Customer with regular updates on its concentration risk management efforts and any changes to its service provision arrangements.""

This new clause would require Atlassian to track dependency on the provider and evaluate concentration risk, providing Customer with greater transparency and control over its reliance on Atlassian's services."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","**Compliance Assessment:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly assess interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. However, Section 7.2, ""Third-Party Products,"" implies a level of interdependence between the Products and Third-Party Products.

**Extracted Clauses:**

7.2. Third-Party Products. Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.

**Recommendation:**

Given the lack of explicit assessment of interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider, it is recommended that Atlassian require an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This can be achieved by:

* Requiring third-party providers to disclose their interdependencies with the Products and how they may impact operational risks.
* Conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential interdependencies and their associated risks.
* Implementing controls to mitigate these risks, such as requiring third-party providers to adhere to specific security and compliance standards.
* Regularly monitoring and reviewing the interdependencies between services to ensure they do not create unintended operational risks."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a compliance concern related to the evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk.

**Definitive Statement:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk, which may expose the customer to monopoly risks and limited alternatives.

**Compliance Gap:** Section 20.13 of the Agreement mentions export restrictions and import restrictions, but it does not address the concentration risk associated with Atlassian's market share. The absence of such an assessment may leave the customer vulnerable to potential risks associated with provider dominance.

**Recommendation:** To address this compliance gap, I recommend adding terms to the agreement that require Atlassian to provide information about its market share, concentration risk, and potential impact on resilience. This could include:

* Requiring Atlassian to disclose its market share and concentration risk in its annual report or other publicly available documents.
* Adding a clause that allows the customer to terminate the agreement if Atlassian's market share or concentration risk increases to a certain threshold.
* Including a provision that requires Atlassian to provide the customer with alternative solutions or services if it experiences a significant disruption or outage.

By addressing this compliance gap, the customer can better understand the potential risks associated with provider dominance and take steps to mitigate them."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","After reviewing the contract, it appears that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. While the contract does mention that the products and services may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions (Section 20.13), it does not specifically address risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.

This lack of consideration for geographical concentration risks is concerning, as it may expose the customer to potential disruptions or losses due to unforeseen events such as natural disasters, infrastructure failures, or regional economic instability. Therefore, I recommend that the contract be revised to include a geographical risk assessment, which should address the potential risks and mitigation strategies associated with location-specific factors."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","Compliance requirement: Third-country providers must comply with EU data protection rules, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Validation: The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules, such as GDPR. However, Section 6.3 (Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA) mentions that Customer must not upload to the Cloud Products any patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This implies that Atlassian may handle sensitive health information, which is subject to GDPR regulations.

Flagged absence: The agreement does not explicitly require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, which may create compliance risks for Atlassian and its customers.

Suggested inclusion: Consider adding a provision that requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, including GDPR, to ensure compliance with EU data protection laws.

Example clause:

""Third-country providers must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other EU data protection regulations, including but not limited to, the processing of personal data, data subject rights, and data breach notification requirements."""
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Compliance Assessment: The agreement does not explicitly address the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, specifically in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance. This omission is concerning, as it may leave the customer vulnerable to non-compliance risks and disputes that cannot be effectively resolved through the legal system.

Recommendation: To mitigate this risk, the agreement should include provisions that assess the legal risks in the provider's country, such as:

* A clause that requires the provider to maintain a robust compliance program, including regular audits and risk assessments, to ensure adherence to local laws and regulations.
* A provision that outlines the provider's procedures for handling law enforcement requests, including notification to the customer and cooperation with authorities.
* A clause that requires the provider to maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect against potential losses or liabilities resulting from non-compliance.
* A provision that establishes a dispute resolution mechanism, such as arbitration or mediation, to resolve any disputes that may arise between the parties, including those related to contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.

By including these provisions, the agreement can better ensure that the provider takes adequate measures to mitigate legal risks and maintain compliance with local laws and regulations."
"Search for clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. Extract these terms for verification.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. The key terms extracted for verification are:

* Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This implies that Atlassian will ensure data is stored and processed within the applicable jurisdiction or in accordance with data localization requirements.
* Section 4.3 (Service Levels) refers to service level commitments for Cloud Products, which may include data storage and processing requirements. However, specific details on data localization are not explicitly mentioned.
* Section 13 (Ownership) states that Customer owns all intellectual property and other rights in Customer Data and Customer Materials provided to Atlassian or used with the Products. This clause does not explicitly address data localization requirements.
* Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. This clause highlights the need for Customer to comply with applicable export and import laws, including data localization requirements.

**Recommendation:**

While the Atlassian Customer Agreement addresses some data localization requirements, I recommend adding specific provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs. This could include:

* Clearly stating data storage and processing requirements for Customer Data in various jurisdictions.
* Identifying the specific countries or regions where data will be stored and processed.
* Providing transparency on data transfer mechanisms and associated risks.
* Establishing procedures for responding to data localization requests or requirements from regulatory bodies.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can better ensure compliance with data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions, thereby mitigating potential risks and ensuring a more secure and compliant experience for its customers."
"Search for provisions assessing country-specific operational risks (e.g., political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues). Highlight gaps in the contract if such assessments are not required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a gap in the contract regarding country-specific operational risks. The contract does not explicitly require Atlassian to assess or mitigate country-specific risks, such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues, in the jurisdictions where the Products will be used or accessed.

This gap is concerning because it may leave customers vulnerable to operational disruptions or losses due to unforeseen country-specific risks. For instance, if a customer is using the Products in a country with a history of political unrest or infrastructure instability, Atlassian's lack of assessment or mitigation of these risks may expose the customer to significant operational risks.

To address this gap, I recommend adding a provision to the contract that requires Atlassian to conduct a country-specific risk assessment and develop a plan to mitigate any identified risks. This could include:

* Conducting a risk assessment of the country-specific risks associated with the use or access of the Products
* Developing a plan to mitigate any identified risks, including providing customers with guidance on how to manage these risks
* Regularly reviewing and updating the risk assessment and mitigation plan to ensure that it remains effective

By incorporating this provision, the contract can better protect customers from country-specific operational risks and ensure that Atlassian takes a proactive approach to managing these risks."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.","**Compliance Statement:** The contract between Atlassian and the Customer does not explicitly mandate regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider on a defined schedule.

**Extracted Provisions:** Section 5.2 of the contract states: ""Upon Atlassian’s written request, Customer will promptly confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use."" This provision implies that Atlassian may request an assessment of Customer's compliance with the Scope of Use, but it does not specify a regular schedule for such assessments.

**Validation:** The contract does not contain any provisions that require regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider on a defined schedule, such as quarterly or annually. This absence of a regular risk assessment process may leave the parties vulnerable to unforeseen risks and potential disruptions to the ICT services.

**Recommendation:** To maintain operational resilience, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments, such as:

""Atlassian and Customer will conduct regular risk assessments of the ICT third-party provider at least annually, or as otherwise agreed upon in writing, to identify and mitigate potential risks to the operation of the Products and Services. The assessments will be documented and shared with the other party, and any identified risks will be addressed in a timely manner.""

This clause would ensure that both parties are aware of potential risks and take proactive steps to mitigate them, thereby maintaining operational resilience."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","After reviewing the contract, it appears that there are no explicit provisions for risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. While Section 20.10 (Force Majeure) mentions that neither party is liable for delays or failures due to events beyond their reasonable control, it does not provide a framework for proactive risk mitigation.

The contract does not specify contingency plans, redundancies, or alternative providers to mitigate potential risks. For example, in the event of a data breach or system failure, the contract does not outline specific steps that Atlassian would take to mitigate the impact.

To address this gap, I suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. This could include:

* Establishing a risk management framework to identify, assess, and prioritize risks
* Developing contingency plans for critical risks, such as data breaches or system failures
* Specifying redundancies, such as backup systems or duplicate data storage, to ensure business continuity
* Identifying alternative providers or suppliers to mitigate supply chain risks
* Establishing a process for regular risk assessments and updates to mitigation plans

By incorporating these provisions, the contract can better address the risks associated with critical business operations and ensure that both parties are prepared to respond to potential disruptions."
"Search for requirements to establish a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider’s performance and operations. Verify if the contract specifies monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics (e.g., service availability, response times).","**Compliance Requirement: Ongoing Monitoring of Risks**

This contract requires Atlassian to maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. Specifically, Section 4.2 (Security Program) states that Atlassian will maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications. However, the contract does not explicitly specify a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to Atlassian's performance and operations.

**Recommendation**

To ensure compliance with this requirement, I recommend that the contract be modified to include provisions for continuous monitoring of risks. This could include specifying monitoring tools, metrics (e.g., service availability, response times), and reporting requirements. For example, the contract could require Atlassian to:

* Use specific monitoring tools (e.g., Nagios, Prometheus) to track service availability and response times
* Report on security incidents and breaches within a specified timeframe (e.g., 24 hours)
* Conduct regular risk assessments (e.g., quarterly) to identify and mitigate potential security threats
* Provide access to monitoring dashboards and reports to the Customer for review and analysis

By including these provisions, the contract can ensure that Atlassian maintains a robust security program that continuously monitors and mitigates risks related to its performance and operations."

5. **Section 10.1 (Fees)**: Customer must pay all applicable amounts directly to the Reseller, and Customer’s order details (e.g., Products and Scope of Use) will be specified in the Order placed by the Reseller with Atlassian on Customer’s behalf.

**Validation:**

These terms require regular reassessment of risks, but they are not triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals. To address this, I suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments, such as:

* Regularly review and update the risk assessment process to ensure it remains effective and aligned with changes in the provider's operations, market conditions, or technological advancements.
* Trigger dynamic risk reassessments upon significant changes, such as:
	+ Changes in the provider's operations, including changes to their security program or data processing practices.
	+ Changes in market conditions, including changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards.
	+ Technological advancements that may impact the security or functionality of the Products.
* Perform risk reassessments at fixed intervals, such as annually or semi-annually, to ensure ongoing compliance and mitigate potential risks.

"Search for provisions addressing the assessment of technological lock-in risks, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies. Extract relevant clauses.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies.","As a compliance officer, I have identified the following provisions addressing the assessment of technological lock-in risks:

The Agreement does not explicitly address the assessment of technological lock-in risks. However, Section 5.1 of the Agreement mentions that Customer may use Modifications (source code) to create bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications of the Software Products. This provision implies that Customer may become dependent on proprietary technologies, which could lead to vendor lock-in.

Additionally, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not modify or create derivative works of the Products, which could limit Customer's ability to switch providers due to proprietary technologies.

To address the risk of vendor lock-in, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies. This could include:

* A provision that requires Atlassian to provide Customer with access to source code or APIs to enable switching to alternative providers.
* A clause that outlines the process for transitioning to alternative providers, including timelines and responsibilities.
* A provision that requires Atlassian to provide support and maintenance for a reasonable period after termination of the Agreement to enable a smooth transition.
* A clause that addresses the ownership and transfer of Customer Data and intellectual property in the event of a transition to alternative providers.

These terms would help mitigate the risk of vendor lock-in and ensure that Customer has a clear plan for transitioning to alternative providers if needed."

Section 2.2 (Restrictions): This clause states that Customer must not permit anyone else to: (c) charge its customers a specific fee for use of the Products, but Customer may charge an overall fee for its own offerings (of which the Products are ancillary). This implies that Customer should assess the risk of relying on specific teams or personnel for its offerings.
2. Section 4.2 (Security Program): Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This clause requires Atlassian to assess and mitigate risks related to data center security and geographical locations.
3. Section 5.2 (License Verification): Upon Atlassian's written request, Customer will promptly confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. This clause implies that Atlassian may request an assessment of Customer's resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific teams or personnel for Software Products usage.
4. Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination): Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or a Subscription Term: (a) Customer's rights to use the applicable Products, Support, or Advisory Services will cease, (b) Customer must immediately cease accessing the Cloud Products and using the applicable Software Products and Cloud Clients, and (c) Customer must delete (or, on request, return) all license keys, access keys, and any Product copies. This clause requires Customer to assess and mitigate risks related to data center security and geographical locations.

To address the compliance requirement, I suggest adding the following requirements to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration:

1. Regular risk assessments: Customer should conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations.
2. Business continuity planning: Customer should develop and maintain business continuity plans to ensure minimal disruption in case of resource concentration risks.
3. Data center security: Customer should assess and mitigate risks related to data center security, such as implementing robust security measures and regular security audits.
4. Geographical location risks: Customer should assess and mitigate risks related to geographical locations, such as implementing disaster recovery plans and ensuring business continuity in case of natural disasters or other geographical risks.

By adding these requirements, Customer can ensure business continuity and minimize potential disruptions related to resource concentration risks."

* Section 3.1 (Responsibility) states that Customer is responsible for its Users' compliance with this Agreement and all activities of its Users, including Orders they may place, apps and Third-Party-Products enabled, and how Users access and use Customer Data.
* Section 3.2 (Login Credentials) requires Customer to ensure that each User keeps its login credentials confidential and must promptly notify Atlassian if it becomes aware of any unauthorized access to any User login credentials or other unauthorized access to or use of the Products.
* Section 4.1 (Customer Data) states that Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.
* Section 5.1 (Modifications) requires Customer to securely store and manage source code for modifications to the Software Products.

However, I have not found any clauses that specifically address measures to mitigate the risks associated with shared resources, such as multi-tenancy in cloud environments or shared personnel across multiple clients. Therefore, I recommend including assessments of shared resource dependencies and specifying mitigation strategies, such as dedicated resources, to ensure that both parties are aware of and are taking steps to manage these risks.

In particular, the contract could benefit from clauses that:

* Specify measures to ensure data isolation and segregation in cloud environments
* Outline procedures for managing shared personnel and resources across multiple clients
* Establish clear guidelines for handling sensitive or confidential information
* Define protocols for incident response and notification in the event of a security breach or unauthorized access

By including these measures, the contract can better mitigate the risks associated with shared resources and ensure that both parties are working together to protect sensitive information and maintain a secure environment."

This compliance assessment reveals a lack of specific provisions addressing resource constraints, such as staff shortages or capacity limitations, and their potential impact on service delivery in the Atlassian Customer Agreement.

Upon reviewing the agreement, it appears that there are no explicit terms or clauses that address the assessment of resource constraints or require contingency plans for resource shortages. This oversight may leave customers and Atlassian vulnerable to service disruptions or delays due to unforeseen resource constraints.

**Recommendation**

To strengthen the agreement and ensure compliance with best practices, I suggest adding the following terms:

1. **Resource Constraint Assessment**: Include a provision that requires Atlassian to assess its resource constraints, including staff shortages and capacity limitations, and to provide customers with regular updates on any potential impact on service delivery.
2. **Contingency Planning**: Add a requirement for Atlassian to develop and implement contingency plans to mitigate the effects of resource shortages, ensuring minimal disruption to service delivery.
3. **Notification and Communication**: Specify that Atlassian must notify customers promptly in the event of resource constraints that may impact service delivery, providing clear communication on the expected duration and impact of any disruptions.
4. **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Consider revising the SLAs to include provisions for resource constraints, outlining the expected response times, resolution times, and service credits in the event of service disruptions caused by resource shortages.

By incorporating these terms, the Atlassian Customer Agreement will be better equipped to address resource constraints and ensure compliance with industry best practices, ultimately enhancing service delivery and customer satisfaction."
"Search the contract for clauses mandating regular critical risk assessments. Extract any mention of assessment frequency, scope, or required documentation. If missing, recommend adding a term specifying periodic risk evaluations.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract does not explicitly require regular critical risk assessments, which is a critical compliance requirement for many organizations.

Upon reviewing the contract, I found no specific clauses mandating regular critical risk assessments. However, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) mentions that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. Additionally, Section 5.2 (License Verification) requires Customer to confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use upon Atlassian's written request.

**Recommendation:** To address this compliance gap, I recommend adding a term specifying periodic risk evaluations to the contract. This could be achieved by inserting a new clause, such as:

""5.3. Risk Assessments: Customer must conduct regular critical risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with its use of the Products. Such assessments must be conducted at least annually, or more frequently as determined by Customer's risk management policies. Customer must document all risk assessments and mitigation strategies, and provide Atlassian with access to such documentation upon request.""

Flag as a gap if no such measures are found.,"Based on the provided contract, it appears that there are no specific mitigation measures for critical risks identified in assessments. The contract does mention that Atlassian will use ""reasonable efforts"" to correct non-conformities in the event of a breach of a Performance Warranty (Section 11.2), but this does not constitute a specific mitigation measure for critical risks.

Furthermore, the contract does not mention contingency plans or predefined responses to address potential risks or disruptions. The only mention of a plan is in Section 20.10, which states that neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement due to events beyond its reasonable control and occurring without that party's fault or negligence. This is not a contingency plan, but rather a general disclaimer of liability.

"Resilience Testing:Search for provisions requiring resilience testing of BCDR plans. Validate if testing frequency and scope are specified. If absent, recommend adding mandatory testing clauses.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have found that there are no specific provisions requiring resilience testing of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans. However, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) does mention that Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data or suspend Customer's access to the Cloud Products if Atlassian becomes aware of a potential issue that may impact the security or operation of the Cloud Products.

To address this gap, I recommend adding a provision that requires resilience testing of BCDR plans, including specifying the testing frequency and scope. This can be achieved by adding a new section, such as Section 4.4 (Resilience Testing), which would read:

""4.4 Resilience Testing. Atlassian requires Customer to conduct regular resilience testing of its BCDR plans to ensure the continuity of its business operations in the event of a disaster or outage. The testing frequency and scope shall be specified in the Order or the Product-Specific Terms. Atlassian recommends that Customer conduct testing at least annually, or as otherwise specified in the Order or Product-Specific Terms. The testing shall cover all critical systems and processes, and Atlassian shall have the right to review and approve the testing plan and results.""

This provision would ensure that Customer takes a proactive approach to testing its BCDR plans, which would help to minimize the risk of business disruptions and data loss."
Incident Reporting Timelines:Search for clauses specifying incident reporting timelines. Extract and confirm if timelines are aligned with regulatory standards. Flag gaps if timelines are not defined.,"Compliance Review: Incident Reporting Timelines

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to incident reporting timelines:

* Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension): Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products, if Atlassian becomes aware of a potential security or operational issue.
* Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination): Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation.
* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification): Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. However, there is no specific timeline for incident reporting in this clause.

Regulatory standards for incident reporting timelines vary depending on the industry and jurisdiction. However, some common guidelines include:

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): Requires organizations to establish incident response plans, including procedures for reporting and responding to incidents within 24 hours.
* ISO 27001: Requires organizations to have an incident response plan in place, including procedures for reporting and responding to incidents within a defined timeframe.
* GDPR: Requires organizations to notify affected individuals and regulatory authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of a data breach.

Based on these regulatory standards, the incident reporting timelines in the Atlassian Customer Agreement are not aligned with industry best practices. Specifically:

* There is no clear timeline for incident reporting in Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension), which may lead to delays in responding to security or operational issues.
* Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) only specifies that Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation, without providing a specific timeline for incident reporting.
* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) does not specify a timeline for incident reporting, which may lead to delays in responding to intellectual property claims.

To align with regulatory standards, I recommend that Atlassian consider adding specific incident reporting timelines to the agreement, such as:

* A 24-hour timeline for reporting and responding to security or operational issues in Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension).
* A 72-hour timeline for notifying affected individuals and regulatory authorities in Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination).
* A specific timeline for reporting and responding to intellectual property claims in Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification)."

**Recommendation:** To ensure timely and effective incident management, Atlassian should consider including an escalation matrix in the agreement, outlining the roles, responsibilities, and communication paths for escalating incidents. This matrix should specify the following:

* Roles and responsibilities of key personnel, such as incident managers, technical leads, and customer support teams
* Clear communication paths for escalating incidents, including email, phone, and ticketing systems
* Timeframes for responding to and resolving incidents, including notification requirements for critical issues
* Escalation levels, such as severity levels (e.g., critical, major, minor) and corresponding response times
* Procedures for documenting and tracking incident escalations, including updates and resolutions

**Example Escalation Matrix:**

| Escalation Level | Response Time | Notification Requirements | Roles and Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | 30 minutes | Immediate notification to incident manager and customer support team | Incident manager, technical lead, customer support team |
| Major | 1 hour | Notification to incident manager and customer support team within 1 hour | Incident manager, technical lead, customer support team |
| Minor | 2 hours | Notification to customer support team within 2 hours | Customer support team |

**Recommendation:**

To strengthen compliance, I recommend adding provisions that require Atlassian to establish monitoring mechanisms for subcontractors, including regular audits, performance reviews, and compliance checks. This would ensure that subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary provider and maintain the integrity of the services provided to customers.
