"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I can confirm that there is no explicit mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. This is a notable gap in the contract, as it does not provide any guidance on whether the provider is easily substitutable or not.

**Gap:** The contract does not include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider, which is a critical aspect of outsourcing agreements. This gap may lead to difficulties in terminating the agreement or switching to a new provider if needed.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend including provisions that define criteria for determining the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. This could include factors such as:

* The provider's ability to meet the customer's specific requirements and needs
* The provider's level of customization and flexibility
* The provider's technical capabilities and infrastructure
* The provider's reputation, reliability, and service quality
* The provider's pricing and contract terms

By including such provisions, the contract can provide a clear understanding of the substitutability of the provider and ensure that the customer has the necessary flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","The contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability, which may lead to ambiguity and potential disputes. To address this, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

* Cost: The total cost of ownership, including acquisition, implementation, maintenance, and support costs.
* Technical specifications: Compatibility with existing infrastructure, data formats, and system integrations.
* Ease of transition: The complexity and duration of the transition process, including training, testing, and deployment.
* Operational complexity: The impact on business operations, including changes to workflows, processes, and personnel.

These criteria are commonly used in the industry and can provide a clear and objective basis for evaluating substitutability. For example, a substitutability assessment could involve a weighted scoring system, where each criterion is assigned a weightage based on its relative importance, and a score is assigned based on the degree of alignment with the criteria. This would enable a more systematic and transparent evaluation of substitutability, reducing the risk of disputes and ensuring that the best solution is chosen for the organization."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","**Compliance Verification: Documentation of Alternative Providers**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a clause that requires documentation of alternative providers in the market. Section 5.2, ""License Verification"", states that Atlassian may request Customer to confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. Additionally, Section 5.2 also mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.

However, I have not found any specific clause that requires Customer to maintain a list of alternative providers or to document these providers. Furthermore, I have not identified any clause that mandates regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.

**Missing Documentation Requirements:**

* A clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers
* A requirement to maintain a list of alternative providers
* A procedure for documenting and updating the list of alternative providers

**Recommendation:**

To strengthen compliance, I recommend including a clause that requires Customer to conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This clause should also specify the frequency of these scans, the scope of the scan, and the requirements for documenting and updating the list of alternative providers. This will ensure that Customer is aware of the market alternatives and can make informed decisions about its use of the Software Products."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I confirm that there is no explicit provision requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. However, Section 10.1(c) of the Agreement mentions that Customer may elect not to renew a Subscription Term if Atlassian modifies the terms of the Agreement, which could potentially impact Customer's operational and strategic decisions. 

However, I would suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility. This could be achieved by including a provision that requires Customer to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers at least annually, or whenever there is a significant change in the market or business needs. The analysis should consider financial, operational, and strategic factors, including but not limited to:

* Financial factors: cost savings, revenue potential, return on investment (ROI), and total cost of ownership (TCO)
* Operational factors: ease of integration, scalability, reliability, and support requirements
* Strategic factors: alignment with business goals, risk management, and future-proofing

By incorporating this provision, Customer can ensure that they are making informed decisions about their technology investments and maintaining strategic flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Observation:**
Atlassian's Customer Agreement lacks specific provisions requiring the customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives, such as through periodic market research.

**Extracted Provisions:**
None found in the Customer Agreement.

**Validation:**
Upon reviewing the Customer Agreement, I did not find any clauses that explicitly require the customer to conduct periodic market research or evaluate emerging alternatives. While the agreement does mention Atlassian's provision of Products and related Support and Advisory Services, it does not impose any obligations on the customer to stay informed about market alternatives.

**Recommendation:**
To ensure the customer is aware of emerging alternatives and can make informed decisions about their Product usage, I recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews. This can be achieved by including a clause that requires the customer to:

* Conduct regular market research to evaluate emerging alternatives
* Provide Atlassian with information about market trends and alternatives
* Use the results of market research to inform decisions about Product usage and subscription terms

Here is an example of a proposed clause:

""Customer agrees to conduct regular market research to evaluate emerging alternatives to the Products and provide Atlassian with information about market trends and alternatives. Customer will use the results of market research to inform decisions about Product usage and subscription terms, and will notify Atlassian of any changes to their market analysis or evaluation of alternatives.""

**Flagged Gap:**
Missing provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.

**Recommendation:**
Add a clause to the Customer Agreement that requires the customer to conduct regular market research and provide information about market trends and alternatives."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","Compliance Requirement: Periodic reviews of existing contracts with the provider are not explicitly mentioned in the contract.

Upon reviewing the contract, I found that Section 2.2 (Restrictions) and Section 6.2 (Product Assessment) imply that the customer is responsible for determining whether the products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use. However, there is no specific requirement to assess existing arrangements with the same provider.

Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian may audit the customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use, but this is not a periodic review of existing contracts.

Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires the customer to comply with all Laws applicable to their business, but this does not specifically address periodic reviews of existing contracts with the provider.

Therefore, I recommend including a provision that requires periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the new agreement. This will help identify any gaps or inconsistencies and ensure that the customer is aware of their obligations and responsibilities under the new agreement."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract does not explicitly require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers, such as third-party vendors or service providers, to identify potential risks and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Flagged Absence:** The contract does not contain specific provisions or requirements for evaluating relationships with closely connected providers, which may lead to potential compliance risks and vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:** To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to include provisions in the contract that require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers, such as:

* Identifying and documenting all closely connected providers
* Conducting regular risk assessments to evaluate potential risks and vulnerabilities
* Establishing clear guidelines and procedures for managing relationships with closely connected providers
* Ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory requirements and industry standards

By including these provisions, the contract can help ensure that relationships with closely connected providers are properly assessed and managed, reducing the risk of compliance issues and reputational damage."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","After reviewing the contract, I can confirm that there is no explicit clause that mandates evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. However, I do find that the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider in Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates), which states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. This implies that the customer should be aware of and monitor the dependencies on Atlassian's subcontractors or Affiliates.

Additionally, Section 5.2 (License Verification) requires the customer to confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use, which may involve tracking the customer's dependency on Atlassian for the Software Products.

To address the concentration risk, I recommend adding a section to the contract that requires Atlassian to provide regular reports on its subcontractors and Affiliates, and to notify the customer in advance of any changes to its subcontractor or Affiliate arrangements. This would enable the customer to assess and mitigate the concentration risk associated with relying on a single provider for multiple services."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","**Compliance Assessment: Interdependencies between Third-Party Services**

The provision assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider is not explicitly stated in the agreement. However, Section 7.2 mentions that ""Customer's use of Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer's behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product.""

This provision suggests that Atlassian will permit access to Customer Data by third-party providers if the customer has enabled the third-party product. However, it does not explicitly assess the interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider.

**Recommendation**

To address this gap, I suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This can be achieved by adding a clause that requires the customer to conduct a risk assessment of third-party products and services used in conjunction with Atlassian's products. The clause could be worded as follows:

""The Customer shall conduct a risk assessment of third-party products and services used in conjunction with Atlassian's products, including assessing how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. The Customer shall provide Atlassian with a written report of the risk assessment, which shall include recommendations for mitigating any identified risks.""

This clause would require the customer to take a proactive approach to managing the risks associated with third-party products and services, and would provide Atlassian with valuable information to help identify and mitigate potential risks."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","**Compliance Evaluation:**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there is a lack of explicit provisions that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk. This is a notable gap, as it does not provide clear guidance on how to assess the potential risks associated with relying on a single provider, such as Atlassian.

**Highlighted Gap:**

The agreement does not contain any clauses that explicitly require the evaluation of Atlassian's market share, concentration risk, or potential monopoly risks. This omission may leave customers without a clear understanding of the potential risks associated with relying on a single provider for their cloud-based services.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, it is recommended that the agreement be modified to include terms that require an evaluation of Atlassian's market share and concentration risk. This could include provisions that:

* Require customers to assess the potential risks associated with relying on a single provider
* Specify the criteria for evaluating market share and concentration risk
* Provide guidance on how to mitigate potential risks associated with provider dominance
* Include provisions for regular reviews and updates to the assessment of market share and concentration risk

By incorporating these terms, customers can better understand the potential risks associated with relying on a single provider and take steps to mitigate those risks."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. The contract does not address risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters. 

The contract does mention that ""Atlassian may identify Customer as a customer of Atlassian in its promotional materials"" (Section 19. Publicity), but this does not relate to geographical concentration risks. Furthermore, the contract does not contain any provisions that would require Atlassian to assess or mitigate risks associated with location-specific factors.

Therefore, I recommend including a geographical risk assessment in the contract to ensure that Atlassian considers and mitigates potential risks associated with its operations in different locations. This could include clauses that require Atlassian to assess and manage risks related to infrastructure reliability, natural disasters, and other location-specific factors that could impact the provision of its services."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","**Compliance Requirement:**

To ensure compliance with EU data protection rules, third-country providers must adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant EU data protection regulations.

**Extracted Provisions:**

Section 4.2 (Security Program) states: ""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures.""

Section 6.3 (Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA) mentions: ""Unless the parties have entered into a ‘Business Associate Agreement,’ Customer must not (and must not permit anyone else to) upload to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to process) any patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.""

Section 4.1 (Customer Data) states: ""Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.""

**Validation:**

These provisions do not explicitly require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations. However, Section 4.2 mentions that Atlassian's security program is designed to protect Customer Data, which implies a level of compliance with EU data protection principles.

**Flagged Absence:**

The absence of explicit provisions requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, such as the GDPR, is a concern. To ensure compliance, it is recommended to include mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations in the agreement.

**Suggested Inclusion:**

Add a provision that requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, such as:

""Third-country providers must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant EU data protection regulations when processing Customer Data. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that Customer Data is processed in accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and accountability, and that Customer Data is protected against unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.""

This provision would ensure that third-country providers are held to the same standards as EU-based providers and that Customer Data is protected in accordance with EU data protection regulations."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Compliance Assessment: The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, specifically in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance."
"Search for clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. Extract these terms for verification.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address data localization requirements, which may pose compliance risks in third-country jurisdictions.

**Extracted Clauses:**

1. Section 4.1: ""Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement."" (This clause implies data processing and transfer across borders, but does not specify data localization requirements.)
2. Section 4.2: ""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure..."" (This clause focuses on data security, but does not address data localization.)
3. Section 4.5: ""Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the relevant Cloud Products..."" (This clause implies data access and control, but does not specify data localization requirements.)
4. Section 13: ""Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, neither party grants the other any rights or licenses to its intellectual property under this Agreement."" (This clause does not address data localization or transfer.)

**Associated Risks:**

* Non-compliance with data localization requirements in third-country jurisdictions may lead to fines, penalties, and reputational damage.
* Data transfer across borders may be subject to regulatory requirements, such as data protection laws, which may not be addressed in the current agreement.

**Recommendation:** Suggest adding data localization provisions to the agreement to align with regulatory and operational needs, ensuring compliance with data protection laws in third-country jurisdictions. This may include:

* Specifying data storage and processing requirements for Customer Data in third-country jurisdictions.
* Establishing data transfer mechanisms and protocols to ensure compliance with data protection laws.
* Defining data localization requirements for Customer Data, including the location of data storage and processing.
* Ensuring that data protection laws and regulations are complied with in third-country jurisdictions.

**Follow-up:** Verify the extracted clauses and associated risks with Atlassian to determine the best course of action for compliance with data localization requirements."
"Search for provisions assessing country-specific operational risks (e.g., political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues). Highlight gaps in the contract if such assessments are not required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a gap in the contract regarding country-specific operational risks. Specifically, there is no provision that assesses or addresses potential risks associated with doing business in certain countries or regions.

The contract does mention that the parties will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Section 20.1), but it does not specifically address country-specific risks such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues. This omission may leave customers vulnerable to unexpected risks and costs associated with operating in certain countries.

To mitigate this risk, I recommend adding a provision that requires Atlassian to evaluate and assess country-specific operational risks before providing services in a particular country or region. This could include conducting due diligence on the local market, assessing the risk of regulatory changes, and implementing measures to mitigate potential risks.

Here is a possible addition to the contract:

""20.16 Country-Specific Operational Risks

Atlassian shall conduct a reasonable evaluation of country-specific operational risks associated with providing services in a particular country or region. This evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, assessing the risk of:

* Political instability or unrest
* Legal uncertainties or changes in laws and regulations
* Infrastructure issues or disruptions
* Currency fluctuations or exchange rate risks

Atlassian shall provide Customer with written notice of any country-specific operational risks identified during this evaluation. Customer may terminate this Agreement if Atlassian fails to provide such notice or if the identified risks are deemed unacceptable by Customer.

By including this provision, Atlassian can better manage country-specific operational risks and ensure that customers are aware of potential risks associated with doing business in certain countries or regions."""

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.","**Compliance Statement:** The contract between Atlassian and the Customer does not explicitly mandate regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider.

**Clause Analysis:** Upon reviewing the contract, I found the following relevant provisions:

* Section 5.2: License Verification - Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. However, this clause does not specifically address critical risk assessments.
* Section 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates - Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. While this clause mentions the use of subcontractors, it does not require regular risk assessments.

**Recommendation:** To maintain operational resilience, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments, such as:

""20.12. Critical Risk Assessments

Atlassian shall conduct regular critical risk assessments of its subcontractors and Affiliates, at least annually, to identify and mitigate potential risks to Customer's data and operations. The assessments shall cover areas such as security, data protection, and business continuity. Atlassian shall provide the results of these assessments to Customer upon request.""

This clause would ensure that Atlassian regularly evaluates and mitigates critical risks associated with its subcontractors and Affiliates, thereby maintaining operational resilience and protecting Customer's interests."

Upon reviewing the agreement, I did not find any provisions that outline specific contingency plans, redundancies, or alternative providers to address potential risks. 

To address this gap, I recommend adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. For instance, the contract could include clauses that outline the procedures for:

* Notification and escalation of risks
* Activation of contingency plans
* Identification and implementation of alternative providers
* Implementation of redundancies to minimize downtime

By incorporating these measures, the contract can provide a clear framework for managing and mitigating risks, ensuring that both parties are prepared to address potential issues that may arise during the performance of the agreement."
"Search for requirements to establish a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider’s performance and operations. Verify if the contract specifies monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics (e.g., service availability, response times).","As the compliance officer, I confirm that the contract requires ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations. Specifically, Section 12.2 of the contract states that Atlassian may suspend Customer's rights to use Products or receive Support or Advisory Services if payment is overdue, and Atlassian has given Customer no fewer than ten (10) days' written notice. However, the contract does not explicitly specify monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements.

To ensure compliance, I recommend including provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics such as service availability, response times, and error rates. This will enable Atlassian to proactively identify and address potential issues, ensuring timely and reliable delivery of services to the Customer."
"Look for clauses requiring regular reassessment of risks to account for changes in the provider’s operations, market conditions, or technological advancements. Extract and validate the terms.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals.","**Compliance Statement:** It is essential for customers to regularly reassess risks associated with their Atlassian subscription to ensure alignment with changing market conditions, technological advancements, and provider operations.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to regular reassessment of risks:

1. **Section 5.2: License Verification**: Atlassian reserves the right to audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. This clause implies that Atlassian may require regular reassessments to ensure compliance with the agreed-upon terms.
2. **Section 10.1(d): Renewals**: The Agreement states that a Subscription Term will automatically renew at Atlassian's then-current rates, subject to the Product, Support, or Advisory Services continuing to be generally available. This clause suggests that customers should reassess their subscription terms and risks associated with renewals.
3. **Section 20.9(c): Changes to this Agreement**: Atlassian may modify the Agreement, including the Policies and Product-Specific Terms, which may impact customer risks. Customers are advised to review and reassess their subscription terms and risks upon notification of changes.

While these clauses do not explicitly require regular reassessments, they imply the need for customers to be aware of changes that may impact their subscription terms and risks.

**Recommendation:** To enhance compliance and risk management, I suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals, such as:

* Upon receipt of notice from Atlassian regarding changes to the Agreement, Policies, or Product-Specific Terms.
* At least annually, to ensure alignment with changing market conditions, technological advancements, and provider operations.
* When significant changes occur in the customer's business, operations, or technology infrastructure that may impact their subscription terms and risks.

By incorporating this requirement, customers can proactively manage risks and ensure their subscription terms remain aligned with their evolving needs."
"Search for provisions addressing the assessment of technological lock-in risks, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies. Extract relevant clauses.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies.","As a compliance officer, I have identified provisions addressing the assessment of technological lock-in risks in the Atlassian Customer Agreement.

The agreement does not explicitly require the evaluation of technological lock-in risks, but it does mention the following relevant clauses:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not ""reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Products"" which could potentially create a barrier to switching providers.
* Section 5.1 (Modifications) mentions that Customer may only use Modifications (bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications of the Software Products) with the Software Products and only in accordance with this Agreement, including the Third-Party Code Policy. This clause may imply that modifications made to the Software Products could create long-term dependencies.
* Section 9 (Ordering Process and Delivery) states that Atlassian may provide login instructions or license keys for Products electronically, to Customer's account, which may imply that Customer's access to the Products is dependent on Atlassian's systems.

However, these clauses do not explicitly address the risks of vendor lock-in or specify potential exit strategies. To address this, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies, such as:

* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide Customer with information about the potential risks of vendor lock-in, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to specify potential exit strategies, such as data portability or interoperability, to enable Customer to switch providers if needed.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide Customer with regular updates on the status of its products and services, including any changes that may impact Customer's ability to switch providers.

By including these clauses, the agreement can better address the risks of vendor lock-in and provide Customer with more control over its technology choices."
"Identify clauses assessing proprietary technology dependencies, such as the use of custom software, unique configurations, or exclusive systems. Validate if these dependencies are documented and monitored.

"Look for terms requiring the provider to evaluate how technological changes (e.g., updates, upgrades, deprecations) might impact the substitutability of services or systems. Verify whether assessments include risks to operational continuity.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend including clauses for periodic evaluation of how technological changes affect continuity and substitutability.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is clear that the provider has a responsibility to ensure operational continuity and substitutability of services. Specifically, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that the customer is not permitted to use the products to develop a similar or competing product or service. However, there is no explicit requirement for the provider to evaluate how technological changes might impact the substitutability of services or systems.

To address this gap, I recommend including clauses for periodic evaluation of how technological changes affect continuity and substitutability. This could be achieved by adding a new section to the agreement, such as Section 5 (Technology Assessment), which would require the provider to:

* Conduct regular assessments of technological changes, including updates, upgrades, and deprecations, to identify potential impacts on operational continuity and substitutability.
* Provide the customer with notice of any changes that may impact operational continuity or substitutability, and offer support and resources to mitigate any risks.
* Develop and implement contingency plans to ensure operational continuity in the event of technological changes that impact substitutability.
* Regularly review and update the agreement to reflect changes in technology and ensure that the customer's interests are protected.

By including these clauses, the provider can demonstrate its commitment to ensuring operational continuity and substitutability, and the customer can have confidence in the provider's ability to adapt to technological changes."
"Search for clauses requiring an assessment of resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations. Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding requirements to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration.","**Compliance Finding:** This Agreement does not explicitly require an assessment of resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations.

Upon reviewing the Agreement, I found that there are no clauses specifically mentioning resource concentration risks or requiring an evaluation of such risks. However, Section 6.2 ""Product Assessment"" mentions that Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer's requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use. This provision implies that Customer should assess the suitability of the Products for its needs, but it does not specifically address resource concentration risks.

**Recommendation:** To address this compliance finding, I suggest adding a provision to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration. This could be achieved by:

* Inserting a new clause, such as Section 6.3 ""Resource Concentration Risk Assessment,"" which requires Customer to evaluate and address risks associated with relying on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations.
* Modifying existing clauses, such as Section 6.2 ""Product Assessment,"" to include specific requirements for assessing resource concentration risks.

Example of a new clause:

""6.3 Resource Concentration Risk Assessment. Customer must assess and mitigate any risks associated with relying on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations for the Products. This assessment must include, but is not limited to, evaluating the impact of a single point of failure, data loss, or other disruptions on the Products and Customer's business operations.""

By incorporating this provision, Customer can ensure that it is aware of and addresses potential resource concentration risks, which can help maintain compliance with relevant regulations and standards."

Section 3.1 of the agreement states that ""Customer may authorize Users to access and use the Products, in accordance with the Documentation and Customer’s Scope of Use."" This suggests that Atlassian may have multiple customers sharing the same resources, including personnel and infrastructure.

However, the agreement does not explicitly specify measures to mitigate the risks associated with shared resources. While Section 4.2 of the agreement mentions Atlassian's ""Security Program"" and its commitment to protecting customer data, it does not address the specific risks associated with shared resources.

Furthermore, Section 5.1 of the agreement allows Atlassian to provide source code to customers for internal use, but it does not specify any measures to prevent the sharing of source code or other sensitive information across multiple customers.

Overall, while the agreement acknowledges the potential risks associated with shared resources, it does not provide sufficient measures to mitigate these risks. I would recommend that Atlassian include assessments of shared resource dependencies and specify mitigation strategies, such as dedicated resources, to ensure the security and integrity of customer data.

Example AI Prompts for Each Requirement","**Compliance Assessment: Resource Constraints and Service Delivery**

As a compliance officer, it is essential to ensure that service delivery is not compromised due to resource constraints such as staff shortages or capacity limitations. Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following provisions addressing resource constraints and their potential impact on service delivery:

* Section 6.2 states that ""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use."" This provision implies that Customer is responsible for assessing their resource constraints and ensuring that they have the necessary capacity to use the Products effectively.
* Section 10.1(e) mentions that ""Customer’s payment obligations under Sections 10.1 (Fees) and 10.2 (Taxes) are not limited by this Section 14.2."" This provision suggests that Customer's payment obligations may not be affected by resource constraints, but it does not explicitly address the potential impact on service delivery.
* Section 20.1 requires that ""each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This provision implies that both parties must comply with laws and regulations related to resource management and service delivery.

However, I have not found any explicit provisions that require contingency plans for resource shortages or assess the potential impact of resource constraints on service delivery. To address this gap, I recommend adding terms to the agreement that:

* Require Customer to evaluate their resource constraints and develop contingency plans to ensure service delivery is not compromised.
* Specify that Atlassian will work with Customer to develop a plan to mitigate the impact of resource constraints on service delivery.
* Establish clear guidelines for service delivery in the event of resource shortages or capacity limitations.

By adding these terms, the agreement can better address the potential risks associated with resource constraints and ensure that service delivery is maintained despite any challenges that may arise."
"Search the contract for clauses mandating regular critical risk assessments. Extract any mention of assessment frequency, scope, or required documentation. If missing, recommend adding a term specifying periodic risk evaluations.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract lacks a specific clause mandating regular critical risk assessments, which is a critical component of effective risk management.

**Extracted Clauses:**

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) mentions that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use, but it does not specify a regular frequency for such audits.
* Section 5.2 (License Verification) requires Customer to confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use upon Atlassian's written request, but it does not establish a regular schedule for such verifications.
* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) requires Atlassian to defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products infringe any intellectual property right of a third party, but it does not specify a regular process for identifying and mitigating potential risks.

**Recommended Addition:**

To address the lack of regular critical risk assessments, I recommend adding a term specifying periodic risk evaluations. This can be incorporated into Section 20 (General Terms) as follows:

**20.8. Risk Management**

* Atlassian and Customer will conduct regular critical risk assessments to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks associated with the Products, Support, and Advisory Services.
* The frequency of such risk assessments will be at least annually, or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties.
* The scope of the risk assessments will include, but not be limited to, an evaluation of:
	+ Potential security risks and vulnerabilities
	+ Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
	+ Third-party dependencies and risks
	+ Business continuity and disaster recovery plans
* The parties will maintain documentation of the risk assessments, including:
	+ A description of the risks identified
	+ An assessment of the likelihood and potential impact of each risk
	+ A plan for mitigating or managing each risk
	+ A record of the actions taken to address each risk

By incorporating this term, the contract will ensure that both parties engage in regular critical risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential risks, thereby enhancing the overall security and compliance posture of the relationship."

The following clauses were identified as potentially contributing to technological lock-in:

1. Section 2.2 (Restrictions) prohibits Customer from modifying or creating derivative works of the Products, which may limit Customer's ability to migrate to alternative software solutions.
2. Section 5.1 (Modifications) requires Customer to keep source code secure and confidential, which may prevent Customer from using the source code to develop alternative software solutions.
3. Section 10.1 (Fees) includes a provision for automatic renewal of Subscription Terms, which may lock Customer into a long-term contractual commitment with Atlassian.
4. Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement) includes a provision for Atlassian to modify the Agreement with 30 days' notice, which may allow Atlassian to introduce changes that could limit Customer's ability to migrate to alternative software solutions.

To mitigate the risk of technological lock-in, I recommend adding the following exit strategies to the Agreement:

1. A provision allowing Customer to terminate the Agreement upon 30 days' notice, without penalty or liability, in the event that Atlassian introduces changes that significantly impair Customer's ability to use the Products.
2. A provision requiring Atlassian to provide Customer with access to the source code and technical documentation for the Products, to enable Customer to develop alternative software solutions.
3. A provision limiting the duration of Subscription Terms to a maximum of 2-3 years, with an option for Customer to renew or terminate the Agreement at the end of each term.
4. A provision requiring Atlassian to provide Customer with a minimum level of interoperability with alternative software solutions, to enable Customer to migrate to alternative software solutions without significant disruption.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there are no explicit clauses assessing shared resource risks, such as multi-tenancy in cloud environments. However, Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. While this section provides some assurance regarding the security of Customer Data, it does not specifically address shared resource risks.

**References:**

* Section 4.2 (Security Program)
* https://www.atlassian.com/trust (Atlassian's security program information)

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate shared resource risks, it is recommended that Atlassian consider adding a clause to the agreement that explicitly addresses multi-tenancy and shared resource risks in cloud environments. This could include:

* A requirement for dedicated resources, such as virtual machines or databases, to ensure that Customer Data is isolated from other customers' data.
* An impact assessment process to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with shared resources.
* Regular security audits and penetration testing to ensure the security of shared resources.

**Example Clause:**

""Atlassian will ensure that all shared resources, including cloud infrastructure and databases, are properly isolated and secured to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data. Atlassian will conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with shared resources. In the event of a security breach, Atlassian will notify Customer promptly and provide reasonable assistance to remediate the issue.""

By incorporating this clause, Atlassian can provide greater assurance to customers regarding the security of their data in cloud environments and mitigate shared resource risks."

20.11.1 Subcontracting Chain Evaluation

Atlassian must conduct a comprehensive review of its subcontracting chain to assess its length, complexity, and associated operational and regulatory risks. This review must consider the number of subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion to ensure that:

* The subcontracting chain does not exceed a reasonable length, taking into account the complexity of the work and the risks associated with subcontracting.
* The subcontractors are properly vetted and qualified to perform the work, and their dependencies are properly managed to minimize risks.
* The geographical dispersion of the subcontractors does not create undue risks or challenges in managing the subcontracting chain.

This evaluation must be conducted prior to the commencement of work and updated regularly to ensure that the subcontracting chain remains compliant with the agreement and applicable laws and regulations.

By adding this clause, Atlassian can ensure that it has a robust framework for managing subcontracting risks and that its subcontracting chain is properly assessed and monitored to minimize operational and regulatory risks."

However, I have not found any specific tools or processes described for ensuring compliance throughout the subcontracting chain. To strengthen the compliance framework, I recommend including requirements for regular chain monitoring, such as reporting structures or dedicated monitoring resources.

Regarding changes to the subcontracting structure, Section 20.11 does not specify any requirements for notification or disclosure of changes to the subcontracting chain. This lack of transparency could lead to unforeseen risks and difficulties in tracking accountability in the event of issues or disputes.

2. **Notification of changes to subcontracting structure**: Atlassian must notify the Customer of any changes to the subcontracting structure, including the addition or removal of subcontractors, and provide written justification for such changes.
