"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I have found no mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. 

This is a notable gap in the contract, as it does not provide any provisions for evaluating the substitutability of the provider. The absence of such provisions may leave the parties uncertain about the ease of replacing the provider in case of a change in circumstances or a need for a different service.

To address this gap, I recommend that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider. This could involve defining criteria for determining substitutability, such as the provider's:

* Ability to meet the same service level agreements (SLAs) as the current provider
* Compatibility with the customer's existing systems and infrastructure
* Ability to provide equivalent or better services at a comparable price
* Reputation and reliability
* Ability to meet regulatory and compliance requirements

By including such provisions, the parties can better understand the substitutability of the provider and make informed decisions about their relationship."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","The contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. However, based on industry standards, possible benchmarks for substitutability assessments could include:

* Technical compatibility: Evaluating whether the replacement product or service meets the same technical specifications and requirements as the original product or service.
* Operational complexity: Assessing the ease of transition from the original product or service to the replacement, including factors such as data migration, system integration, and user training.
* Cost: Comparing the costs of the original product or service to the replacement, including factors such as licensing fees, maintenance costs, and any additional expenses.
* Ease of transition: Evaluating the effort required to transition from the original product or service to the replacement, including factors such as the number of users affected, the complexity of the system, and the availability of support resources.

To clarify the substitutability criteria, it is recommended to add measurable criteria to the contract, such as:

* The replacement product or service must meet or exceed the technical specifications of the original product or service.
* The replacement product or service must be compatible with the existing infrastructure and systems.
* The replacement product or service must be evaluated based on a cost-benefit analysis, considering factors such as total cost of ownership, return on investment, and net present value.
* The transition process must be completed within a specified timeframe, with minimal disruption to business operations.

By incorporating these measurable criteria, the contract can provide a clear and objective framework for assessing substitutability and ensuring that any replacement product or service meets the necessary standards."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","**Compliance Findings:**

The contract reviewed does not explicitly require documentation of alternative providers in the market. However, Section 7.1 (Third-Party Code) mentions that Atlassian may include open-source software and commercial third-party software in the Products, and Section 7.2 (Third-Party Products) states that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace.

**Missing Documentation Requirements:**

1. There is no requirement to maintain a list of alternative providers in the market.
2. The contract does not specify the need to document the evaluation or comparison of alternative providers.
3. There is no provision for regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.

**Recommendation:**

To enhance compliance and ensure that Customer is aware of alternative providers in the market, it is recommended to include a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This clause should specify the frequency of market scans, the scope of the scan (e.g., specific industries or product categories), and the documentation requirements for alternative providers identified. The revised clause could read:

""Customer shall conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers in the market. At least once a year, Customer shall provide Atlassian with a list of at least three (3) alternative providers for each Product or service used, including their features, pricing, and any other relevant information. Customer shall also provide Atlassian with a written evaluation of each alternative provider, including their strengths and weaknesses compared to Atlassian's Products or services."""
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","Compliance Observation: The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers, which is a critical component of strategic flexibility and informed decision-making.

Upon reviewing the agreement, I did not find any explicit requirements for a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. While Section 20.15 mentions that ""Customer's purchases are not contingent on delivery of any future functionality or features,"" this provision does not address the need for a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers.

To maintain strategic flexibility, I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to ensure that Atlassian's customers can make informed decisions about their technology investments. This could include provisions such as:

* A requirement for customers to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers at regular intervals (e.g., every 2-3 years)
* A provision that outlines the factors to be considered in the analysis, including financial, operational, and strategic factors
* A requirement for customers to provide Atlassian with a written report summarizing the results of the analysis and any recommendations for changes to their technology investments

By incorporating these provisions, the agreement can better support customers' strategic flexibility and ensure that they are making informed decisions about their technology investments."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Alert:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require customers to maintain awareness of market alternatives through periodic market research. This omission may leave customers vulnerable to potential risks, such as being unaware of emerging competitors or innovative solutions that could impact their business.

**Validation:**

Upon reviewing the agreement, I found the following relevant clauses:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) prohibits customers from using the Products to develop a similar or competing product or service.
* Section 6.2 (Product Assessment) requires customers to determine whether the Products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use.
* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires customers to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and conventions.

However, these clauses do not specifically address the need for customers to stay informed about market alternatives.

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate potential risks, I recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. This could be achieved by including a clause, such as:

* ""Customer agrees to periodically review and assess the market for emerging alternatives, competitors, and innovative solutions that may impact their business. Customer shall maintain awareness of market trends and developments and shall notify Atlassian in writing of any changes or updates that may affect their use of the Products.""

This addition would help ensure that customers remain informed and aware of market developments, allowing them to make informed decisions about their business and use of the Products."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","**Compliance Requirement:** The contract does not explicitly require a comprehensive assessment of existing arrangements with the same provider, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements.

**Analysis:** Section 5.2 of the contract mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use, but this is limited to a one-time audit every 12 months, and only upon Atlassian's written request. There is no requirement for a periodic review of all existing contracts with the provider.

**Gap:** The contract does not include a requirement for periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider, which may lead to a lack of visibility into the overall scope and usage of Atlassian products and services across the organization. This may result in potential risks, such as:

* Uncontrolled growth of Atlassian licenses or subscriptions
* Unmanaged costs and expenses
* Inefficient use of resources and assets
* Non-compliance with contractual terms and conditions

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, it is recommended that the organization includes a requirement for periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. This can be achieved by adding a clause to the contract that requires Atlassian to provide regular reports on the usage and scope of its products and services, and for the organization to conduct regular audits and assessments to ensure compliance with contractual terms and conditions."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Compliance Review: Relationship Assessment with Closely Connected Providers

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers, specifically Third-Party Code and Third-Party Products. However, upon reviewing the contract, it appears that these relationships are not explicitly identified or documented.

Provision 7.1 Third-Party Code Policy states that open source software and commercial third-party software included in the Products are subject to the Third-Party Code Policy. Additionally, Provision 7.2 Third-Party Products mentions that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace.

However, the contract does not provide clear requirements for identifying and documenting these relationships, nor does it specify how to evaluate risks associated with connected providers. To ensure compliance, it is recommended to include requirements to assess and document these relationships, such as:

* Identifying and documenting all third-party providers used in conjunction with the Products
* Evaluating the risks associated with these providers, including their business practices, data handling, and security measures
* Establishing procedures for monitoring and managing these relationships to ensure compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws

By including these requirements, Atlassian can ensure that relationships with closely connected providers are properly assessed and documented, reducing the risk of non-compliance and potential harm to its customers."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that may relate to concentration risk:

* Section 20.13 ""Export Restrictions"" mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, which may imply a need to assess the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services.
* Section 10.1(d) ""Increased Scope of Use"" states that Atlassian will charge Customer for any increased Scope of Use at Atlassian's then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term. This clause may indicate a need to track dependency on the provider to ensure that Customer is not over-relying on a single provider.
* Section 20.11 ""Subcontractors and Affiliates"" mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. This clause may imply a need to assess the concentration risk of relying on a single provider, especially if Atlassian uses subcontractors or Affiliates for multiple services.

However, I did not find any explicit clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services or require tracking dependency on the provider. Therefore, I recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks, such as:

* Section 22 ""Concentration Risk Management"" that requires Atlassian to:
	+ Identify and assess concentration risks related to relying on a single provider for multiple services.
	+ Develop and implement a plan to mitigate concentration risks, including diversifying services or providers.
	+ Regularly review and update the plan to ensure it remains effective in managing concentration risks.

This additional section would provide clarity and ensure that both parties are aware of the importance of managing concentration risks in their relationship."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement contains provisions that address the use of third-party products and services, but it does not explicitly assess interdependencies between services provided by third-party providers.

**Extracted Clauses:**

* Section 7.2: ""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product.""
* Section 7.2: ""Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.""

**Recommendation:** To address potential interdependencies and operational risks, I suggest adding a clause to assess how third-party services might amplify these risks. This could be achieved by:

* Requiring an assessment of interdependencies between services provided by third-party providers, as part of the onboarding process for new third-party products or services.
* Specifying that Customer must evaluate and mitigate potential operational risks associated with the use of third-party products or services, and that Atlassian will not be liable for any such risks.
* Requiring third-party providers to provide information about their services, including any potential interdependencies, and for Atlassian to verify this information before permitting the use of their services with Atlassian products.

**Example Clause:**

""7.3 Assessment of Interdependencies: Customer must assess and mitigate potential operational risks associated with the use of Third-Party Products, including any interdependencies between services provided by third-party providers. Atlassian will not be liable for any operational risks arising from the use of Third-Party Products. Customer must provide Atlassian with information about its assessment and mitigation of such risks, and Atlassian reserves the right to verify this information before permitting the use of Third-Party Products with Atlassian products."""

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","**Compliance Evaluation:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk, which may expose customers to monopoly risks and limited alternatives. A review of the agreement reveals that there are no clauses specifically addressing the assessment of provider dominance or its potential impact on resilience.

**Gap Identification:**

* The agreement does not include terms that require Atlassian to disclose its market share, concentration risk, or the number of customers it serves.
* There are no provisions that address the potential risks associated with Atlassian's dominance in the market, such as limited alternatives for customers or the impact on innovation.
* The agreement does not require Atlassian to implement measures to mitigate concentration risk, such as diversifying its customer base or providing alternatives for customers to switch to other providers.

**Recommendation:**

To address these gaps, the agreement should be amended to include terms that require Atlassian to:

* Disclose its market share and concentration risk to customers upon request.
* Assess and mitigate concentration risk through measures such as diversifying its customer base or providing alternatives for customers to switch to other providers.
* Regularly review and update its market share and concentration risk assessment to ensure that it remains compliant with applicable laws and regulations.

By incorporating these terms, customers can better understand the potential risks associated with Atlassian's dominance in the market and take steps to mitigate those risks."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","Upon reviewing the contract, I confirm that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. The contract does not address location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters as potential risks that could impact the provision of services.

This omission is a concern, as geographical concentration risks can have significant implications for the continuity and reliability of services. I recommend that the contract be revised to include a geographical risk assessment that considers the potential impact of location-specific factors on the provider's operations. This could include provisions for:

* Identifying high-risk locations and mitigating strategies to address them
* Establishing protocols for emergency response and business continuity in the event of natural disasters or infrastructure failures
* Regular monitoring and review of geographical risks to ensure that the provider is prepared to address any potential issues

By including a geographical risk assessment in the contract, the provider and customer can work together to identify and mitigate potential risks, ensuring a more resilient and reliable service."

However, the specific requirement for third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR) is not explicitly stated.

**Flagged Absence:**

The absence of a specific clause requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) may lead to non-compliance risks. To address this, it is recommended to include a provision that explicitly states:

""Atlassian will ensure that all third-country providers, including subcontractors and affiliates, comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant EU data protection laws and regulations.""

**Suggested Provision:**

This provision would ensure that Atlassian's third-country providers, including subcontractors and affiliates, adhere to EU data protection regulations, thereby mitigating non-compliance risks and ensuring the protection of Customer Data."

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address country-specific operational risks, such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues, that may impact the provision of its products and services.

**Gap Analysis:**

The contract's lack of provisions assessing country-specific operational risks creates a gap in compliance, particularly for Atlassian's global operations. This omission may lead to unforeseen risks, costs, and reputational damage if not addressed. To mitigate these risks, I recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.

**Recommendation:**

Atlassian should consider incorporating provisions that assess and address country-specific operational risks, such as:

1. Country risk assessments: Regularly conduct risk assessments to identify potential operational risks in countries where Atlassian operates.
2. Country-specific terms and conditions: Include country-specific terms and conditions in the contract to address local laws, regulations, and infrastructure requirements.
3. Compliance requirements: Ensure that Atlassian's compliance program addresses country-specific requirements, including data protection, tax, and labor laws.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can better manage country-specific operational risks, ensure compliance with local regulations, and maintain a strong reputation globally."

* The provider's ability to meet its obligations under this Agreement
* The provider's security and data protection controls
* The provider's business continuity and disaster recovery plans
* The provider's compliance with relevant laws and regulations

The ICT third-party provider shall provide the Customer with a written report detailing the results of the risk assessments, including any identified risks and mitigation strategies. The Customer reserves the right to request additional information or clarification on any aspect of the risk assessments.""

This clause ensures that the ICT third-party provider is held accountable for conducting regular critical risk assessments, which is essential for maintaining operational resilience and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).

Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","Upon reviewing the contract, I can confirm that risk mitigation measures are specified, but they are limited to a general statement in Section 20.10 (Force Majeure) that neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement due to events beyond its reasonable control and occurring without that party's fault or negligence.

However, this provision does not constitute a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy. To address this gap, I recommend adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as:

1. Predefined actions for specific risk scenarios, such as:
	* Natural disasters or power outages: contingency plans for data backup and recovery, alternative power sources, or temporary relocation of critical operations.
	* Cybersecurity breaches: incident response plans, data encryption, and regular security audits.
	* Supply chain disruptions: alternative suppliers, inventory management, and logistics contingency planning.
2. Redundancies: identifying and implementing redundant systems, processes, or personnel to ensure business continuity in case of an outage or disruption.
3. Alternative providers: identifying and engaging with alternative service providers to mitigate the risk of dependence on a single provider.

To incorporate these measures, I suggest adding a new section to the contract, such as ""Risk Mitigation Measures"" or ""Business Continuity Planning,"" which outlines the specific actions to be taken in case of identified risks. This would provide a more comprehensive and actionable risk management strategy."

Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies.","Compliance Note: The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the assessment of technological lock-in risks or the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies.

However, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Products, which may be seen as a limitation on the ability to assess or mitigate lock-in risks. Additionally, Section 5.1 (Modifications) allows Atlassian to provide source code for internal use, but requires Customer to keep it secure and confidential, which may limit the ability to assess or mitigate lock-in risks.

It is recommended that Atlassian consider adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies to ensure that customers are aware of the potential risks and can make informed decisions about their use of the Products. This could include provisions such as:

* A requirement for Atlassian to provide information about the potential risks of vendor lock-in and the availability of exit strategies
* A provision allowing customers to audit the Products and related systems to assess the risks of lock-in
* A requirement for Atlassian to provide support for migration or transfer of data and applications to alternative providers

Upon reviewing the Agreement, it appears that these proprietary technology dependencies are documented and monitored to some extent. For example, Section 5.1 (Modifications) requires Customer to keep source code secure, confidential, and only make it available to employees who have a legitimate need to access and use the source code. Similarly, Section 6.1 (Disclosures and Rights) requires Customer to ensure they have made all necessary disclosures and obtained all necessary rights and consents for Atlassian to use Customer Data and Customer Materials.

**Follow-up:**

However, it is recommended that the Agreement include additional provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies. This could include:

* A clause that requires Customer to identify and document all proprietary technology dependencies prior to implementing them in the Products.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to review and approve all proprietary technology dependencies prior to their implementation in the Products.
* A clause that requires Customer to provide regular updates on the status of proprietary technology dependencies, including any changes or modifications made to them.

By including these provisions, the Agreement can ensure that proprietary technology dependencies are properly documented and monitored, reducing the risk of non-compliance and ensuring that both parties are aware of their respective obligations and responsibilities."

Nonetheless, if Atlassian becomes aware that: (a) Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others (including relating to a takedown request received following the guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations), or (b) Customer's use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may: (i) limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or (ii) suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products.""

However, I have not found any explicit provisions requiring an assessment of resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations. To address this gap, I recommend adding requirements to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration, such as:

* Conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential concentration points, including reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations.
* Developing strategies to mitigate identified risks, such as diversifying resources, implementing redundancy measures, or establishing backup systems.
* Regularly reviewing and updating risk assessments to ensure they remain accurate and effective in addressing potential concentration risks.

By incorporating these requirements, Atlassian can better ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards, and maintain a robust and resilient infrastructure to support its customers' needs."

The contract acknowledges the risk of shared resources in Section 2.1, which states that ""Atlassian grants Customer a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Products and related Support and Advisory Services for its and its Affiliates' internal business purposes."" However, this clause does not explicitly address the risk of shared resources.

Section 3.1, which discusses Users, states that ""Customer may authorize Users to access and use the Products, in accordance with the Documentation and Customer's Scope of Use."" This clause implies that multiple users may be accessing the same resources, but it does not specify measures to mitigate the risks associated with shared resources.

Section 5.1, which discusses Modifications, states that ""Customer must keep such source code secure (on computer devices and online repositories controlled by Customer), confidential, and only make it available to Customer's employees who have a legitimate need to access and use the source code to create and maintain Modifications."" This clause suggests that Customer may have access to sensitive information, but it does not address the risk of shared resources.

Section 5.2, which discusses License Verification, states that ""Upon Atlassian's written request, Customer will promptly confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use."" This clause implies that Atlassian may have access to Customer's systems and resources, but it does not specify measures to mitigate the risks associated with shared resources.

Section 6.1, which discusses Customer Obligations, states that ""Customer must ensure it has made all disclosures and obtained all rights and consents necessary for Atlassian to use Customer Data and Customer Materials to provide the Cloud Products, Support or Advisory Services."" This clause suggests that Customer may be sharing sensitive information with Atlassian, but it does not address the risk of shared resources.

In summary, while the contract acknowledges the risk of shared resources, it does not specify measures to mitigate these risks. To address this gap, I recommend including assessments of shared resource dependencies and specifying mitigation strategies, such as dedicated resources, in the contract.

**Recommendation:** Include a clause that requires Atlassian to perform regular risk assessments of shared resource dependencies and to specify mitigation strategies to minimize the risks associated with shared resources. For example:

""Atlassian will perform regular risk assessments of shared resource dependencies and will specify mitigation strategies to minimize the risks associated with shared resources. These mitigation strategies may include, but are not limited to, dedicated resources, access controls, and data encryption.""

**Follow-up:** Recommend that Atlassian provide regular updates on the results of these risk assessments and mitigation strategies to ensure that the risks associated with shared resources are being adequately addressed."

These terms do not explicitly address resource constraints or contingency planning. They focus on the scope of use and Customer's responsibilities for determining the suitability of the Products for their business needs.

**Recommendation:**

To address potential resource constraints and their impact on service delivery, it is recommended to add terms that require contingency planning and evaluation of resource constraints. This could include:

* Requiring Customer to provide notice to Atlassian in case of staff shortages or capacity limitations that may impact service delivery.
* Requiring Atlassian to provide contingency plans for resource shortages, such as prioritizing support requests or providing additional training to Customer's staff.
* Specifying that Customer is responsible for ensuring that their staff have the necessary skills and resources to effectively use the Products and related Support and Advisory Services.

* **Termination for Convenience (Section 12.2):** Customer may terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term upon notice for any reason, subject to certain conditions.
* **Exclusivity (Section 20.15):** The Products, Support and Advisory Services in each Order are purchased separately and not contingent on purchase or use of other Atlassian products and services.

However, the agreement could be improved to provide more explicit exit strategies for customers, particularly in the following areas:

* **Migration to Open-Source Alternatives:** The agreement does not provide a clear path for customers to migrate to open-source alternatives if Atlassian's proprietary software becomes too expensive or restrictive.
* **Contractual Exclusivity:** While the agreement states that the Products, Support and Advisory Services are purchased separately, it does not provide a clear mechanism for customers to exit the agreement if they wish to use alternative products or services.
* **Long-Term Contractual Commitments:** The agreement does not provide a clear mechanism for customers to exit the agreement if they wish to terminate their subscription or reduce their scope of use.

To address these gaps, I recommend adding the following exit strategies to the agreement:

* **Migration to Open-Source Alternatives:** Add a provision that allows customers to migrate to open-source alternatives if Atlassian's proprietary software becomes too expensive or restrictive.
* **Contractual Exclusivity:** Add a provision that allows customers to exit the agreement if they wish to use alternative products or services.
* **Long-Term Contractual Commitments:** Add a provision that allows customers to terminate their subscription or reduce their scope of use without penalty, subject to certain conditions.

By incorporating these exit strategies, the agreement can provide more robust protections for customers and mitigate the risk of technological lock-in."

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate shared resource risks, I recommend adding a requirement for dedicated resources or impact assessments. This can be achieved by:

* Adding a new clause to Section 4 (Cloud Products) that explicitly addresses shared resource risks, such as:
	+ ""Atlassian will ensure that Customer Data is stored in a dedicated environment, separate from other customers, to mitigate shared resource risks.""
	+ ""Atlassian will conduct regular impact assessments to identify and mitigate potential shared resource risks associated with multi-tenancy in cloud environments.""

	+ ""Atlassian will implement dedicated resources for each customer to prevent shared resource risks.""
	+ ""Atlassian will conduct regular risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential shared resource risks associated with multi-tenancy in cloud environments.""

By adding these requirements, Atlassian can provide customers with greater assurance that their data is protected from shared resource risks associated with multi-tenancy in cloud environments."

**Section 5.1 (Resilience Testing)**

Atlassian and Customer agree to conduct regular resilience testing of BCDR plans, including scenario-based exercises or live drills, to ensure the effectiveness of their respective BCDR plans. The purpose of this testing is to:

* Validate the integrity of BCDR plans
* Identify areas for improvement
* Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations
* Maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer Data

The frequency of resilience testing shall be at least annually, or as otherwise specified in the applicable Order. The scope of testing shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

* Testing of BCDR plans for each Product
* Verification of backup and restore procedures
* Evaluation of incident response and disaster recovery procedures
* Review of communication protocols and procedures

Atlassian and Customer shall maintain records of the resilience testing, including the results, recommendations for improvement, and any actions taken in response to the testing. These records shall be made available to each other upon request.

It appears that the Atlassian Customer Agreement does not include clear timelines for incident reporting in the event of ICT disruptions or security incidents. This is concerning, as regulatory requirements often mandate that organizations report high-severity incidents within a specific timeframe, such as within 24 hours.

To address this, I recommend that Atlassian include clear incident reporting timelines in the Agreement, specifically:

* For high-severity incidents, Atlassian should commit to reporting incidents to affected customers within 24 hours of becoming aware of the incident.
* For medium-severity incidents, Atlassian should commit to reporting incidents to affected customers within 72 hours of becoming aware of the incident.
* For low-severity incidents, Atlassian should commit to reporting incidents to affected customers within 7-10 business days of becoming aware of the incident.

Incident Reporting Timelines:Search for clauses specifying incident reporting timelines. Extract and confirm if timelines are aligned with regulatory standards. Flag gaps if timelines are not defined.,"**Compliance Findings: Incident Reporting Timelines**

Incident reporting timelines are crucial in ensuring that organizations respond promptly to security incidents and minimize potential harm to customers and stakeholders. Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to incident reporting timelines:

* Section 4.5: Removals and Suspension - Atlassian may remove or suspend access to Customer Data if it becomes aware of potential security issues or unauthorized access. However, the agreement does not specify a specific timeline for incident reporting.
* Section 15.1: IP Indemnification - Atlassian must defend Customer from third-party claims alleging intellectual property infringement. While the agreement requires timely notice of potential infringement claims, it does not specify a specific timeline for incident reporting.
* Section 16.3: Exclusions - The agreement excludes confidential information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party. However, this clause does not specify a timeline for incident reporting.

**Regulatory Standards Comparison**

To determine if the incident reporting timelines are aligned with regulatory standards, I have compared the clauses with the following regulatory requirements:

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) - Requires incident response and reporting within 24-72 hours.
* GDPR - Requires notification of personal data breaches within 72 hours.
* HIPAA - Requires notification of security incidents within 60 days.

**Gaps in Incident Reporting Timelines**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not specify a clear incident reporting timeline, which may not align with regulatory standards. Specifically:

* There is no defined timeline for reporting security incidents or potential unauthorized access.
* The agreement does not specify a timeframe for notifying customers or stakeholders in the event of a security incident.
* The lack of a clear incident reporting timeline may create gaps in compliance with regulatory standards, potentially exposing Atlassian to reputational and financial risks.

**Recommendations**

To address these gaps, I recommend that Atlassian:

1. Define a clear incident reporting timeline, aligning with regulatory standards (e.g., 24-72 hours for NIST CSF, 72 hours for GDPR).
2. Specify a timeframe for notifying customers and stakeholders in the event of a security incident.
3. Update the agreement to include a provision for incident reporting and response, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements."

This lack of clarity may lead to confusion and delays in addressing critical issues. To ensure effective incident management, I recommend including an escalation matrix in the agreement to outline roles, responsibilities, and communication paths. This matrix should detail the steps to be taken in the event of an incident, including who should be notified, the order of communication, and the expected response times."
"Root Cause Analysis:Identify clauses requiring root cause analysis for incidents. Extract timelines and responsibilities, if present. Recommend including root cause analysis terms if absent.","As a compliance officer, I have identified the following clauses that require root cause analysis for incidents:

**Section 11.2: Performance Warranty Remedy**
If Atlassian breaches a Performance Warranty and Customer makes a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue, Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity. This clause implies that Atlassian is responsible for conducting a root cause analysis to identify the cause of the breach and take corrective action.

**Section 12.4: Effect of Termination**
Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or a Subscription Term, Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation. This clause implies that Atlassian is responsible for conducting a root cause analysis to identify the cause of the termination and ensure that Customer Data is deleted in accordance with the agreed-upon procedures.

**Section 15.1: IP Indemnification**
Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. This clause implies that Atlassian is responsible for conducting a root cause analysis to identify the cause of the infringement and take corrective action.

**Recommendation**
To ensure compliance with these clauses, I recommend that Atlassian include the following terms in the agreement:

* A clear definition of root cause analysis and its objectives
* A timeline for conducting root cause analysis, including the deadline for completion
* A description of the responsibilities of both parties in conducting root cause analysis
* A procedure for documenting and reporting the findings of the root cause analysis
* A process for implementing corrective actions based on the findings of the root cause analysis

These provisions require Atlassian to take corrective actions in response to material breaches or intellectual property infringement claims.

Section 12.3 states that if Atlassian fails to cure a material breach, Customer may terminate the Agreement. In this scenario, Atlassian is required to take corrective actions to address the breach, including procuring rights for continued use of the Products, replacing or modifying the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminating the affected Subscription Term.

Section 15.4 outlines Atlassian's obligations in response to intellectual property infringement claims, requiring the company to take corrective actions such as procuring rights for continued use of the Products, replacing or modifying the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminating the affected Subscription Term.

The timelines for corrective actions are not explicitly stated in the Agreement, but it is implied that Atlassian must take prompt action to address material breaches or intellectual property infringement claims. The scope of corrective actions is also not explicitly defined, but it is clear that Atlassian must take reasonable efforts to address the breach or infringement claim.

However, I have identified a gap in the Agreement regarding the requirement for Atlassian to conduct root cause analysis (RCA) to identify the underlying causes of material breaches or intellectual property infringement claims. While the Agreement requires Atlassian to take corrective actions, it does not explicitly mandate the company to conduct an RCA to identify the root causes of the issue. This gap may need to be addressed to ensure that Atlassian takes effective corrective actions to prevent future breaches or infringement claims."

However, Section 20.11 does state that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under the Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under the Agreement. This suggests that Atlassian has some level of oversight and control over its subcontractors, but it does not explicitly require monitoring or regular audits.

Based on this analysis, I recommend adding monitoring requirements to ensure subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary provider. This could include:

* Regular audits to verify subcontractor compliance with Atlassian's standards and policies
* Performance reviews to assess subcontractor performance and identify areas for improvement
* Compliance checks to ensure subcontractors meet relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards

While Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement, it does not specify the requirements for disclosure of subcontractors.

To ensure transparency of subcontracting chains, I suggest adding the following provisions to the Agreement:

* Atlassian must disclose the names and contact information of all subcontractors in the subcontracting chain to Customer upon request.
* Atlassian must provide a clear and detailed description of the subcontracting arrangement, including the scope of work, duration, and payment terms.
* Customer must be notified in writing of any changes to the subcontracting arrangement, including the addition or removal of subcontractors.
* Atlassian must ensure that all subcontractors comply with the same security and data protection standards as Atlassian.

By incorporating these transparency provisions, the Agreement can provide greater assurance to Customer that their data and business interests are being protected throughout the subcontracting chain."
"Search for terms requiring notification and risk assessment for changes in subcontracting chains. Extract and validate details. If missing, recommend including notification and evaluation clauses.","Compliance Review: Notification and Risk Assessment for Changes in Subcontracting Chains

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is evident that Atlassian may use subcontractors in the performance of its obligations under the agreement. However, the agreement does not explicitly require notification and risk assessment for changes in subcontracting chains.

**Extracted Details:**

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the agreement.
* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) also states that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under the agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under the agreement.

**Validation:**

While the agreement acknowledges the use of subcontractors, it does not require notification to the customer in the event of a change in subcontracting chains. This may leave the customer vulnerable to potential risks associated with changes in subcontracting chains, such as changes in data protection practices or security measures.

**Recommendations:**

To ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks, I recommend including the following clauses in the agreement:

1. **Notification Clause:** Atlassian should be required to notify the customer in writing within a specified timeframe (e.g., 30 days) in the event of a change in subcontracting chains, including the identity of the new subcontractor and the terms of the subcontractor agreement.
2. **Risk Assessment Clause:** The agreement should require Atlassian to conduct a risk assessment in the event of a change in subcontracting chains, to ensure that the new subcontractor meets the same standards and requirements as Atlassian, including data protection and security measures.
3. **Contractor Agreement Requirements:** The agreement should specify the minimum requirements for subcontractor agreements, including data protection and security measures, to ensure that Atlassian's subcontractors meet the same standards as Atlassian.

By including these clauses, the agreement can provide greater transparency and accountability for changes in subcontracting chains, ensuring that the customer is informed and protected in the event of such changes."
