"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","**Compliance Conclusion:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. However, there are some clauses that imply a shared responsibility between Atlassian and the customer. 

Section 6.1 of the Agreement states that the customer is responsible for making all disclosures and obtaining all rights and consents necessary for Atlassian to use customer data and customer materials to provide the cloud products, support, or advisory services. This implies that the customer has some level of responsibility for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, including DORA.

Additionally, Section 20.1 of the Agreement requires each party to comply with all laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. This clause suggests that the customer is responsible for ensuring compliance with DORA obligations.

However, there is no clear statement that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, nor is there a reference to non-transfer of compliance obligations."

After reviewing the contract, it is clear that Atlassian, as the financial entity, has retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. The contract comprehensively covers various financial regulations, including tax laws, export restrictions, and government end-user requirements. However, there are some areas where additional clarity is needed to ensure that Atlassian's regulatory responsibilities are explicitly acknowledged.

**Comprehensive Coverage of Applicable Regulations**

The contract references various financial services laws, including tax laws, export restrictions, and government end-user requirements. However, it does not explicitly mention other relevant regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) laws. To ensure comprehensive coverage, it is recommended that the contract be updated to include references to these regulations.

**Non-Delegation of Regulatory Responsibilities**

The contract does not explicitly state that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to third parties. While the contract mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations, it does not make clear that these entities will not be responsible for regulatory compliance. To avoid any potential confusion, it is recommended that an explicit clause be added to the contract stating that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities.

**Clear Acknowledgment of Ongoing Regulatory Obligations**

The contract acknowledges that Atlassian has ongoing regulatory obligations, but it does not explicitly state that these obligations will continue beyond the term of the agreement. To ensure clarity, it is recommended that an explicit clause be added to the contract stating that Atlassian's regulatory obligations will continue beyond the term of the agreement.

**Recommendation**

To address the above concerns, it is recommended that an explicit clause be added to the contract covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should include the following elements:

* A comprehensive list of applicable financial services laws and regulations
* A statement that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to third parties
* A clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations beyond the term of the agreement
* A statement that Atlassian will retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws and regulations

By adding this clause, the contract will provide clear and comprehensive coverage of Atlassian's regulatory responsibilities, ensuring that the financial entity is held accountable for all applicable financial services laws."

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend restructuring agreement to ensure all essential elements are properly organized and documented.","After reviewing the contract, I can confirm that it generally follows a structured format, but there are some areas that require attention to ensure all essential elements are properly organized and documented.

**Verification:**

The contract does not have a traditional table of contents, but it is organized into clear sections with headings, which facilitates easy navigation and understanding of the agreement's terms. The sections are logically structured, with each section addressing a specific aspect of the agreement, such as ""Overview,"" ""Use of Products,"" ""Customer Obligations,"" and ""Term and Termination.""

However, there is a lack of cross-referencing between sections, which might make it difficult for the reader to understand the relationships between different clauses. For example, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) is not explicitly linked to Section 6 (Customer Obligations), which also deals with restrictions on the use of the Products.

**Missing Elements:**

1. **Definition of Terms:** While the contract includes a section (Section 21) that defines key terms, it would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive glossary or definition section to clarify any ambiguous or technical terms used throughout the agreement.
2. **Signature Blocks and Dates:** The contract does not include signature blocks or dates for the parties involved. This is a critical element, as it provides a clear record of the parties' agreement and the date on which the agreement was executed.
3. **Cross-Referencing:** As mentioned earlier, there is a lack of cross-referencing between sections, which can make it challenging to understand the relationships between different clauses.

**Recommendations:**

To ensure all essential elements are properly organized and documented, I recommend restructuring the agreement as follows:

1. **Create a comprehensive table of contents** that outlines the sections and subsections of the agreement.
2. **Include a clear and concise definition of terms** section that provides a comprehensive glossary of key terms used throughout the agreement.
3. **Add signature blocks and dates** for the parties involved to provide a clear record of the agreement and the date on which it was executed.
4. **Implement cross-referencing** between sections to clarify the relationships between different clauses and make the agreement easier to navigate.
5. **Consider adding a section on ""Amendments and Waivers""** to outline the process for making changes to the agreement and to specify the requirements for waiving any rights or obligations under the agreement.

By implementing these recommendations, the agreement will be more comprehensive, easier to understand, and better equipped to withstand potential disputes or challenges."
