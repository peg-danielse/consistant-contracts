"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I can confirm that there is no mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider.

**Gap identified:** The contract does not include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider, which is a critical aspect of compliance and risk management. This gap should be addressed by including clauses that outline criteria for determining substitutability, such as:

* Evaluating the provider's technical capabilities and infrastructure
* Assessing the provider's reliability, availability, and uptime
* Reviewing the provider's security measures and data protection practices
* Considering the provider's scalability and flexibility
* Evaluating the provider's customer support and service level agreements (SLAs)

Including such provisions would enable the parties to assess the substitutability of the provider and make informed decisions about the continuity of services in case of changes or disruptions."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","The contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. While it mentions that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use, it does not provide clear guidelines on what constitutes technical compatibility or operational complexity.

However, based on industry standards, possible benchmarks for substitutability assessments could include:

* Technical compatibility: evaluating the compatibility of the new product or service with existing infrastructure, systems, and processes.
* Operational complexity: assessing the ease of transition, including the number of users affected, the complexity of data migration, and the potential impact on business operations.
* Cost: evaluating the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the new product or service, including upfront costs, ongoing maintenance, and support expenses.
* Ease of transition: assessing the ease of transitioning from the current product or service to the new one, including the availability of resources, training, and support.

To strengthen the contract, it is recommended to add measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition. This will provide clarity and ensure that both parties have a clear understanding of what is expected in terms of substitutability."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","After reviewing the contract, I have identified the following clause related to alternative providers:

**Section 6.2: Product Assessment**

Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use.

**Section 3.2: Login Credentials**

Customer must ensure that each User keeps its login credentials confidential and must promptly notify Atlassian if it becomes aware of any unauthorized access to any User login credentials or other unauthorized access to or use of the Products.

There is no explicit clause requiring the documentation of alternative providers in the market. However, Section 6.2 implies that the Customer is responsible for assessing the suitability of the Products for their needs, which may involve researching alternative providers.

**Missing Documentation Requirements:**

1. There is no requirement to maintain a list of alternative providers or to document market scans.
2. The contract does not specify how the Customer should assess the suitability of alternative providers or what criteria should be used to evaluate them.
3. There is no provision for regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.

**Recommendation:**

To address these gaps, I recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This could be achieved by adding a new section, such as:

**Section 6.3: Alternative Providers**

Customer must conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers that meet their requirements. The Customer must maintain a list of these alternative providers and update it regularly. The list must include, but not be limited to, the following information:

* Provider name and contact details
* Product or service description
* Pricing and licensing terms
* Key features and functionalities
* Any relevant certifications or compliance requirements

This clause would ensure that the Customer has a comprehensive understanding of the market and can make informed decisions about their use of the Products. It would also provide a clear requirement for the Customer to maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation of alternative providers."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","**Compliance Findings:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. However, Section 10.1(c) (Renewals) allows either party to elect not to renew a Subscription Term, which implies a level of strategic flexibility. Nevertheless, this provision does not necessitate a thorough cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers.

**Recommendation:**

To maintain strategic flexibility and ensure informed decision-making, I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses of alternative providers. This would involve conducting a comprehensive analysis of financial, operational, and strategic factors, including:

1. Financial considerations: Evaluate the costs associated with maintaining or terminating the current agreement, including any potential savings or additional expenses.
2. Operational factors: Assess the impact on business operations, including any changes to workflows, processes, or infrastructure.
3. Strategic considerations: Examine how alternative providers align with the company's overall strategy, including any potential benefits or risks.

By incorporating regular cost-benefit analyses, Atlassian can ensure that customers are equipped to make informed decisions about their agreements and maintain strategic flexibility in an ever-changing market."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Alert:** Atlassian's Customer Agreement requires customers to be aware of market alternatives, but the language is not explicit enough to ensure ongoing market research and review.

Upon reviewing the Agreement, I found the following relevant clause:

**Section 6.2. Product Assessment:** ""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use.""

However, this clause does not explicitly require customers to maintain awareness of market alternatives or conduct periodic market research. To ensure compliance with this requirement, I recommend adding the following provision:

**Proposed Addition:** ""Customer must periodically review and assess market alternatives to the Products, including emerging technologies and competitive offerings, to ensure that the Products continue to meet their evolving needs and requirements.""

This provision would ensure that customers remain aware of market developments and can make informed decisions about their use of Atlassian's Products."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","Compliance requirement identified: Regular assessment and review of existing arrangements with Atlassian are not explicitly mentioned in the contract. This omission may expose the organization to potential risks, such as missed opportunities for cost savings, inefficient use of resources, or inadequate compliance with contractual obligations.

Specifically, the contract does not require a review of the number, type, and scope of existing arrangements with Atlassian, which are essential for maintaining effective contract management and compliance. The absence of such a requirement may lead to gaps in contract administration, including:

* Inadequate monitoring of contract terms and conditions
* Insufficient tracking of changes to contract scope or pricing
* Failure to identify opportunities for cost savings or process improvements
* Inadequate management of contract renewals or terminations

To address this gap, I recommend that the organization includes periodic reviews of all existing contracts with Atlassian in its compliance program. This can be achieved by:

* Scheduling regular review meetings with the procurement team and contract administrators
* Conducting thorough assessments of existing contracts to identify areas for improvement
* Developing and implementing a plan to address any gaps or issues identified during the review process
* Establishing clear metrics and benchmarks to measure the effectiveness of the contract review process

By incorporating regular contract reviews into its compliance program, the organization can ensure that it maintains effective contract management, identifies opportunities for cost savings and process improvements, and minimizes the risk of non-compliance with contractual obligations."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions related to third-party relationships and vendors, but no specific requirements for assessing relationships with closely connected providers. Specifically, Section 7.2 of the Agreement mentions the use of third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products (Third-Party Products) with Atlassian's Products, stating that Customer's use of such products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider.

However, the Agreement does not explicitly require Atlassian or Customer to assess or document relationships with closely connected providers. This is a notable omission, as it is a common compliance requirement to evaluate risks associated with connected providers, particularly in industries where regulatory requirements are stringent.

To address this gap, I recommend including a provision that requires Atlassian and Customer to identify and document their relationships with closely connected providers, assess potential risks associated with these relationships, and implement measures to mitigate such risks. This could involve:

* Identifying all closely connected providers and documenting their relationships with Atlassian and Customer
* Assessing potential risks associated with these relationships, including data security, intellectual property, and compliance risks
* Implementing measures to mitigate identified risks, such as contractual requirements, due diligence, or regular monitoring
* Regularly reviewing and updating the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements

By including this provision, Atlassian and Customer can better manage risks associated with connected providers, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and maintain a secure and reliable partnership."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","**Compliance Assessment:**

After reviewing the contract, I have identified the following clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services:

* Section 5.2 (License Verification) requires Atlassian to audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use, which may indicate a risk of concentration if Customer relies heavily on a single provider for multiple services.
* Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) implies a risk of concentration if Customer uses the Products in a way that is heavily dependent on a single provider, which may be subject to export restrictions.
* Section 20.14 (Government End-Users) suggests a risk of concentration if Customer is a government end-user and relies heavily on a single provider for multiple services.

However, the contract does not explicitly require tracking dependency on the provider. To address this, I recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks, such as:

* Section 22 (Concentration Risk Assessment): Atlassian and Customer shall jointly assess the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services and agree on measures to mitigate such risks. The assessment shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
	+ Identifying critical services and dependencies on the provider
	+ Evaluating the potential impact of provider failure or termination on the services
	+ Developing a plan to mitigate risks, including diversification of services or providers
	+ Regularly reviewing and updating the concentration risk assessment to ensure it remains relevant and effective

This section will ensure that both parties are aware of the potential risks associated with concentration and take proactive measures to mitigate them."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","Compliance Note: This Agreement does not explicitly address interdependencies between services provided by third-party providers, which is a critical consideration for risk management and operational resilience.

The relevant clause is Section 7.2, which states: ""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product.""

However, this clause does not explicitly assess the interdependencies between these services or their potential impact on operational risks.

To address this gap, I recommend adding a clause that requires an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. For example:

""7.2. Interdependencies with Third-Party Services. Customer acknowledges that the use of Third-Party Products with the Products may introduce interdependencies between services, which may amplify operational risks. Atlassian recommends that Customer assesses these interdependencies and takes steps to mitigate any resulting risks.""

This additional clause would help ensure that Customer is aware of the potential risks associated with using third-party services and takes steps to manage them."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","**Compliance Evaluation:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the provider's market share and concentration risk, which is a critical consideration for evaluating the resilience of a provider. This omission raises concerns about the potential for monopoly risks and limited alternatives, which could negatively impact the customer's ability to switch providers or negotiate better terms.

**Gaps in Compliance:**

* Section 20.14 (Government End-Users) mentions that the agreement is subject to the Government Amendment, which may address some concerns related to provider dominance. However, this is not sufficient to address the broader issue of market share and concentration risk.
* The agreement does not include any terms or conditions that would require Atlassian to assess or disclose its market share or concentration risk.
* There is no provision for customers to request or negotiate changes to the agreement based on concerns about provider dominance or limited alternatives.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I recommend adding terms to the agreement that require Atlassian to:

* Disclose its market share and concentration risk in the relevant market
* Assess and mitigate the potential impact of provider dominance on customer resilience
* Provide customers with regular updates on market share and concentration risk
* Offer customers the option to negotiate changes to the agreement based on concerns about provider dominance or limited alternatives

This would help ensure that customers are aware of the potential risks associated with Atlassian's market dominance and can make informed decisions about their use of the products and services."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","Compliance Assessment: Geographical Concentration Risks

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. However, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) does specify that the Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of the State of California if the customer is domiciled elsewhere. This suggests a geographical concentration risk in terms of jurisdictional risks, but it does not address location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.

Recommendation: To address geographical concentration risks, it is recommended that the contract be amended to include a geographical risk assessment or a specific clause that addresses location-specific factors. This could include provisions related to disaster recovery, business continuity, and risk management strategies to mitigate potential disruptions to the provider's operations."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the relevant clause related to data protection:

**Clause 4.1: Customer Data**

""Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.""

**Clause 4.2: Security Program**

""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures.""

**Clause 4.2 (continued):**

""Further information about Atlassian’s security program is available on the Atlassian Trust Center at https://www.atlassian.com/trust, as updated from time to time.""

**Clause 7.1: Third-Party Code**

""This Agreement and the Third-Party Code Policy apply to open source software and commercial third-party software Atlassian includes in the Products.""

**Clause 7.2: Third-Party Products**

""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product.""

**Clause 16: Confidentiality**

""Unless expressly permitted by the disclosing party in writing, the receiving party must: (a) hold the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, and (b) only use such Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement.""

**Clause 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

While the Agreement mentions the use of third-party providers and the protection of Customer Data, I have concerns about the following:

* The Agreement does not explicitly mention the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the need for third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules.
* The Security Measures mentioned in Clause 4.2 are not explicitly linked to the GDPR or other EU data protection regulations.
* The Third-Party Code Policy mentioned in Clause 7.1 is not explicitly linked to the GDPR or other EU data protection regulations.

To address these concerns, I recommend including the following provisions:

* A clause explicitly stating that third-country providers must comply with EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR, when processing Customer Data.
* A clause requiring Atlassian to ensure that its third-party providers comply with EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR.
* A clause explicitly stating that Atlassian's Security Measures are designed to meet the requirements of EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR.

Example of the revised clause:

**Clause 4.2 (revised):**

""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable EU data protection regulations.""

**Clause 7.2 (revised):**

""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Third-country providers must comply with EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR, when processing Customer Data.""

**Clause 16 (revised):**

""Unless expressly permitted by the disclosing party in writing, the receiving party must: (a) hold the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, and (b) only use such Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement. The receiving party must also ensure that any third-party providers it engages to process Confidential Information comply with EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR.""

**Clause 20.1 (revised):**

""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement, including EU data protection regulations, such as the GDPR.""

These revised clauses ensure that third-country providers are required to comply with EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR, when processing Customer Data."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Compliance assessment reveals that the Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, particularly in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance. This omission may expose the parties to risks associated with varying levels of law enforcement capabilities and regulatory interpretations. To mitigate these risks, I recommend adding specific provisions to assess legal risks in the provider's country, such as:

*   A clause outlining the provider's responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in its jurisdiction
*   A provision requiring the provider to maintain adequate records and documentation to support compliance efforts
*   A mechanism for addressing potential regulatory changes or developments that may impact contract enforceability
*   A clause allowing for the modification or termination of the agreement in the event of significant changes to the provider's jurisdiction's laws or regulations

By incorporating these provisions, the agreement can better address the complexities of law enforcement and regulatory compliance in the provider's jurisdiction, ensuring a more robust and compliant contract."
"Search for clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. Extract these terms for verification.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have found the following clauses related to data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions:

**Clause 4.2 (Security Program)**: Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures. Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.

**Clause 20.14 (Government End-Users)**: If Customer is a United States federal, state, or local government customer, this Agreement is subject to, and is varied by, the Government Amendment available at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/government-amendment.

**Clause 16.2 (Confidential Information)**: The receiving party must hold the disclosing party's Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement.

These clauses suggest that Atlassian has implemented security measures to protect Customer Data, but there is no explicit provision for data localization requirements or associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. However, Clause 20.13 and 20.14 imply that Customer must comply with export and import Laws, which may involve data localization requirements in certain jurisdictions.

To address these gaps, I recommend adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs, such as:

* Specifying the jurisdictions where Customer Data will be stored and processed
* Describing the measures taken to ensure compliance with data localization requirements in third-country jurisdictions
* Establishing procedures for handling data requests from government authorities in third-country jurisdictions
* Ensuring that Customer Data is not transferred to jurisdictions with weaker data protection laws or regulations"
"Search for provisions assessing country-specific operational risks (e.g., political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues). Highlight gaps in the contract if such assessments are not required.

Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have found that there are no provisions specifically assessing country-specific operational risks, such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues. This is a notable gap in the contract, as it may leave customers exposed to unforeseen risks when operating in certain regions.

As a compliance officer, I would recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract to ensure that customers are aware of potential operational risks and can take necessary precautions. This could include incorporating clauses that:

* Require customers to perform due diligence on country-specific risks before using the Products
* Specify the types of country-specific risks that may impact the use of the Products
* Outline the measures that Atlassian will take to mitigate country-specific risks
* Establish a process for customers to report and manage country-specific risks

* Section 5.2. License Verification: This section mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. However, this is not a critical risk assessment, but rather a license verification process.
* Section 2.1. Permitted Use: This section mentions that Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services. However, there is no specific mention of regular risk assessments.

Given the absence of a clear mandate for periodic critical risk assessments, I recommend adding a clause that requires Atlassian to conduct regular assessments of critical risks associated with its ICT third-party provider. This would help ensure operational resilience and compliance with industry best practices.

**Recommended Clause:** Atlassian shall conduct regular critical risk assessments of its ICT third-party provider at least annually, or more frequently if required by industry standards or regulatory requirements. These assessments shall be documented and maintained in accordance with Atlassian's standard procedures."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","The contract between Atlassian and the customer specifies various provisions for risk management, but it does not explicitly outline risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. While the contract mentions that Atlassian will use ""reasonable efforts"" to correct non-conformities and that the customer may terminate the agreement in case of a material breach, it lacks specific details on proactive measures to mitigate potential risks.

For example, Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) states that upon expiration or termination of the agreement, Atlassian will delete customer data, but it does not specify any measures to prevent data loss or unauthorized access in case of a disaster or system failure. Similarly, Section 20.10 (Force Majeure) excuses both parties from liability for delays or failures caused by events beyond their control, but it does not outline any contingency plans or alternative arrangements to minimize the impact of such events.

To address these gaps, I recommend adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as:

* Predefined actions for specific risk scenarios, such as data breaches or system failures
* Contingency plans for critical risks, including backup and disaster recovery procedures
* Redundancies and fail-safes to ensure business continuity in case of disruptions
* Alternative providers or backup services to minimize dependence on a single supplier
* Regular risk assessments and reviews to identify and address potential risks proactively

By incorporating these measures, the contract can better mitigate critical risks and provide a more robust framework for managing potential disruptions."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals.","**Compliance Requirement:** Regular Reassessments of Risks in Contracts

As a compliance officer, I must emphasize the importance of incorporating regular risk reassessments into contracts to ensure that the agreement remains effective and compliant with changing market conditions, technological advancements, and the provider's operations. This is particularly crucial in contracts involving software, cloud services, or other technology-based products.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I identified the following clauses that relate to risk reassessments:

1. **Section 5.2: License Verification** - This clause requires Customer to confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. Atlassian may also audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance.
2. **Section 12.2: Termination for Convenience** - This clause allows Customer to terminate the Agreement or a Subscription Term upon notice for any reason. While this clause provides flexibility, it does not explicitly require regular risk reassessments.
3. **Section 20.9: Changes to this Agreement** - This clause allows Atlassian to modify the Agreement from time to time, with modifications becoming effective at the next Order or renewal. However, this clause does not require Customer to reassess risks or provide input on changes.

**Missing Clauses:** To ensure that the contract remains effective and compliant, I recommend adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals. This could be achieved by adding a clause similar to the following:

* **Section [New]: Risk Reassessments** - Customer and Atlassian shall jointly perform a risk reassessment of the Agreement at least once every 12 months, or upon significant changes to the provider's operations, market conditions, or technological advancements. The reassessment shall consider the impact of such changes on the Agreement and make recommendations for updates or modifications to ensure continued compliance and effectiveness.

By incorporating this clause, Customer and Atlassian can ensure that their agreement remains aligned with changing market conditions, technological advancements, and the provider's operations, reducing the risk of non-compliance and ensuring a successful partnership."
"Search for provisions addressing the assessment of technological lock-in risks, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies. Extract relevant clauses.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies.","Compliance finding: The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the assessment of technological lock-in risks or provide specific exit strategies for customers in case of a switch to a different provider.

Relevant clauses that may be related to this issue are:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions): Prohibits customers from reverse-engineering, decompiling, or disassembling the Products, which could limit their ability to understand and potentially switch to alternative technologies.
* Section 5.2 (License Verification): Allows Atlassian to audit customers' use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the Scope of Use. While this clause is primarily aimed at ensuring customers do not exceed their licensed capacity, it could also be used to monitor and control customers' use of proprietary technologies.
* Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian): Provides limited protection for customers in case of intellectual property infringement, but does not address the risk of vendor lock-in.
* Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions): Requires customers to comply with applicable export and import laws, but does not provide guidance on how to manage technological lock-in risks.

To address this compliance issue, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies, such as:

* A clause that requires customers to assess the risks of vendor lock-in and develop a plan for potential exit strategies, including the use of open-source alternatives or migration to different providers.
* A provision that outlines the steps Atlassian will take to facilitate a smooth transition for customers who decide to switch to a different provider, including providing access to documentation, APIs, or other resources that enable customers to transition their systems.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to maintain a level of compatibility with open standards or industry-recognized protocols, to ensure that customers have a viable exit strategy in case of a switch to a different provider."
"Identify clauses assessing proprietary technology dependencies, such as the use of custom software, unique configurations, or exclusive systems. Validate if these dependencies are documented and monitored.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies.","Compliance Assessment: The Atlassian Customer Agreement identifies clauses related to proprietary technology dependencies, including the use of custom software, unique configurations, and exclusive systems, but lacks explicit documentation and monitoring provisions for these dependencies.

Specifically, Section 5 of the Agreement addresses the use of custom software and modifications to the Software Products, requiring Customer to keep source code secure and confidential. However, there is no provision for documenting or monitoring these dependencies, which is a critical compliance requirement.

Recommendation:

To ensure compliance with proprietary technology dependencies, the Agreement should include provisions for evaluating and documenting these dependencies. This can be achieved by adding clauses that require:

A thorough review of the Atlassian Customer Agreement reveals a lack of explicit clauses requiring an assessment of resource concentration risks. However, implicit requirements for risk assessment and mitigation can be inferred from various provisions. Specifically, Section 4.3 (Service Levels) mentions that Atlassian will maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, implying a commitment to risk management. Similarly, Section 16.2 (Obligations) requires the receiving party to hold the disclosing party's Confidential Information in confidence, which may involve assessing and mitigating risks associated with data concentration.

To strengthen the agreement, I suggest adding explicit requirements to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration. This could be achieved by incorporating the following provisions:

*   Section 4.3 (Service Levels) could be expanded to include a specific requirement for Atlassian to conduct regular risk assessments and provide customers with information on the concentration of resources, such as data centers or teams.
*   A new section, Section 4.4 (Risk Assessment and Mitigation), could be added to require customers to assess and mitigate risks associated with resource concentration, including data, teams, or geographical locations.

**Proposed Additions:**

**Section 4.4: Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

*   ""4.4 Risk Assessment and Mitigation. Customer acknowledges that resource concentration risks may exist, including but not limited to reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations. Customer shall regularly assess and mitigate such risks to ensure business continuity and data security.""
*   ""Customer shall provide Atlassian with information on their risk assessment and mitigation strategies, and Atlassian shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Customer in identifying and addressing resource concentration risks.""

These proposed additions would strengthen the agreement by explicitly requiring customers to assess and mitigate resource concentration risks, while also ensuring that Atlassian provides assistance and support in this regard."

Customer agrees to conduct regular resilience testing of its BCDR plans to ensure the Products and related Support and Advisory Services can be restored within the agreed-upon recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) in the event of a disaster or outage. Customer will test its BCDR plans at least twice a year, or as specified in the Product-Specific Terms, and will provide Atlassian with the results of these tests. Atlassian reserves the right to request additional testing or information to verify Customer's compliance with this Section.""

This recommended clause specifies the testing frequency and scope, ensuring that Customer regularly tests its BCDR plans to maintain the integrity and availability of the Products and related Support and Advisory Services."
Incident Reporting Timelines:Search for clauses specifying incident reporting timelines. Extract and confirm if timelines are aligned with regulatory standards. Flag gaps if timelines are not defined.,"**Compliance Alert: Incident Reporting Timelines**

Incident reporting timelines are crucial in ensuring timely response to security incidents, minimizing potential damage, and maintaining regulatory compliance. Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to incident reporting timelines:

* Section 4.5: Removals and Suspension - Atlassian may remove or suspend access to Customer Data if it becomes aware of potential security threats or unauthorized access. The clause does not specify a specific timeline for incident reporting.
* Section 15.4: Mitigation - In response to an actual or potential Infringement Claim, Atlassian may procure rights for Customer's continued use of the Products or replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Products. The clause does not specify a specific timeline for incident reporting.
* Section 20.1: Compliance with Laws - Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business, including incident reporting requirements. However, the clause does not specify a specific timeline for incident reporting.

**Regulatory Standards Comparison**

Regulatory standards, such as ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and PCI-DSS, typically require incident reporting timelines to be defined and communicated to stakeholders. For example:

* ISO 27001: Incident reporting should be done within 24 hours of detection.
* NIST 800-53: Incident reporting should be done within 1 hour of detection.
* PCI-DSS: Incident reporting should be done within 24 hours of detection.

**Gaps in Incident Reporting Timelines**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not define specific incident reporting timelines, which may lead to:

* Inadequate response to security incidents, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
* Non-compliance with regulatory standards, potentially resulting in fines or penalties.
* Inefficient incident management, leading to delays in containment and recovery.

**Recommendation**

To ensure compliance with regulatory standards and maintain a robust incident response plan, I recommend that Atlassian define and communicate specific incident reporting timelines in the agreement, such as:

* Section 4.5: Removals and Suspension - Atlassian will notify Customer of potential security threats or unauthorized access within 24 hours.
* Section 15.4: Mitigation - In response to an actual or potential Infringement Claim, Atlassian will notify Customer of the incident within 1 hour.
* Section 20.1: Compliance with Laws - Each party will comply with all Laws applicable to its business, including incident reporting requirements, and will notify the other party within 24 hours of detection.

By defining and communicating incident reporting timelines, Atlassian can ensure a timely and effective response to security incidents, maintain regulatory compliance, and protect Customer Data."

"Root Cause Analysis:Identify clauses requiring root cause analysis for incidents. Extract timelines and responsibilities, if present. Recommend including root cause analysis terms if absent.","Compliance Findings: The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires a thorough analysis of incidents to identify the root cause, particularly in cases of system failures or security breaches.

Clause 4.5 Removals and Suspension states that Atlassian may remove or suspend Customer Data if it becomes aware that the data may violate the Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others. In such cases, Atlassian may limit access to or remove the relevant Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products. This clause implies a responsibility on Atlassian to investigate and identify the root cause of the issue.

Clause 5.2 License Verification requires Customer to promptly confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. This clause implies a responsibility on Customer to conduct regular audits and root cause analysis to ensure compliance with the Agreement.

Clause 11.2 Performance Warranty Remedy requires Customer to make a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue. This clause implies a responsibility on Customer to conduct root cause analysis to identify the source of the issue and provide evidence to support the claim.

Recommendation: To strengthen the Agreement, I recommend including explicit root cause analysis terms in Clauses 4.5 and 5.2, outlining the responsibilities of both parties to conduct thorough investigations and identify the root cause of incidents. This will provide clarity on the expectations and obligations of both parties, ensuring a more effective and efficient incident response process."

Flag gaps if corrective action requirements are missing.,"**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly outline provisions for corrective actions based on root cause findings, indicating a gap in the agreement's compliance requirements.

**Root Cause Analysis:** A root cause analysis is a systematic approach to identifying the underlying causes of a problem or issue. In the context of compliance, root cause analysis is essential to ensure that corrective actions address the underlying issues rather than just symptoms.

**Corrective Actions:** Corrective actions are measures taken to prevent or mitigate the recurrence of a problem or issue. In compliance, corrective actions are critical to ensure that organizations implement measures to address identified weaknesses or non-compliances.

**Compliance Gap:** The absence of explicit provisions for corrective actions based on root cause findings creates a compliance gap. This gap may lead to inconsistent or inadequate implementation of corrective actions, which can compromise the effectiveness of compliance programs.

**Recommendation:** To address this compliance gap, the Atlassian Customer Agreement should be revised to include provisions outlining corrective actions based on root cause findings. These provisions should specify timelines, scope, and responsibilities for implementing corrective actions."

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses specifying restrictions and conditions for subcontracting. These clauses are as follows:

1. Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.
2. Section 20.11 also mentions that Atlassian may subcontract to its Affiliates, implying that subcontracting may be limited to Affiliates.

However, I have not found any clauses specifying limitations on types of subcontracted services, geographical locations, or critical functions. This absence of restrictions and conditions may leave the contract open to potential risks and uncertainties, particularly if critical or important functions are subcontracted.

Recommendation:

To ensure clear boundaries for subcontracting, I recommend including the following terms in the contract:

* A clear definition of critical or important functions that cannot be subcontracted, such as data processing, customer support, or product development.
* Restrictions on subcontracting to third-party vendors, requiring Atlassian to obtain prior written consent from the customer before subcontracting any critical or important functions.
* Geographical limitations on subcontracting, specifying that subcontracting is only permitted within certain regions or countries.
* Requirements for subcontractors to maintain confidentiality, data protection, and security standards that meet or exceed Atlassian's own standards.
* Provisions for customer approval and consent before subcontracting, including the right to inspect and audit subcontractors' performance.

By including these terms, the contract can provide clear boundaries and protections for the customer, ensuring that critical or important functions are not subcontracted without their knowledge or consent."

This omission is concerning, as it may leave Atlassian vulnerable to risks associated with its subcontractors, such as financial instability, operational disruptions, or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.

To mitigate this risk, I recommend that Atlassian consider adding a mandatory subcontractor risk assessment process as part of its overall third-party risk management framework. This process should include a comprehensive evaluation of subcontractors' financial health, operational capabilities, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. By doing so, Atlassian can ensure that its subcontractors are reliable and capable of meeting its obligations, thereby minimizing the risk of reputational damage, financial losses, or regulatory non-compliance."

This section does not explicitly require an assessment of subcontracting chain length and complexity.

To validate if the assessments consider the number of subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion, I would recommend adding clauses to the contract to address these requirements. Specifically, the following provisions could be added:

*   A clause requiring Atlassian to conduct a comprehensive review of its subcontracting chain, including the number of subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion, to assess operational and regulatory risks.
*   A clause mandating that Atlassian's subcontractors and affiliates comply with the same level of due diligence and risk assessment as Atlassian itself.
*   A clause requiring Atlassian to maintain records of its subcontracting chain, including information on subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion, to facilitate ongoing monitoring and risk assessment.

By incorporating these provisions, the contract can ensure that Atlassian and its subcontractors and affiliates prioritize transparency, accountability, and risk management in their subcontracting arrangements.

The term states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

While the term acknowledges the use of subcontractors, it does not explicitly mention audits or compliance checks. To enhance compliance, I suggest adding monitoring requirements to ensure that subcontractors comply with relevant laws and regulations. This can be achieved by adding a clause to the subcontractor agreement, such as:

""Atlassian will conduct regular audits and compliance checks on subcontractors to ensure they are meeting the requirements of this Agreement and relevant laws and regulations. Subcontractors must cooperate fully with Atlassian's audits and provide access to their records and systems as necessary.""

By adding this clause, Atlassian can ensure that subcontractors are properly monitored and that compliance risks are mitigated. This will also help to maintain the trust and confidence of customers, such as you, in Atlassian's ability to manage subcontractors effectively."

	+ Financial stability and solvency
	+ Compliance with laws and regulations
	+ Quality of services and products
	+ Security practices and data protection

	+ Subcontractor's compliance with data protection regulations and industry standards
	+ Subcontractor's adherence to security best practices and protocols
	+ Subcontractor's ability to meet performance and quality requirements
	+ Subcontractor's financial stability and ability to meet payment obligations
* Frequency and timing: Atlassian should perform risk assessments of subcontractors on a regular basis, such as annually or bi-annually, to ensure ongoing compliance and identify potential risks.

**Additional Recommendation:** Atlassian should also consider including a provision in the agreement that requires subcontractors to undergo a similar risk assessment process and to maintain a similar level of compliance with laws and regulations."

This omission is a compliance risk as it may hinder the ability to identify and manage potential subcontractor-related risks, such as non-compliance with laws or regulations, data breaches, or poor quality of services.

**Suggested Provisions:**

To address this compliance gap, consider adding the following transparency provisions to the agreement:

1. **Subcontractor Disclosure:** Include a clause requiring Atlassian to disclose all subcontractors involved in the performance of its obligations under the agreement. This disclosure should include the subcontractor's name, location, and a description of the services they will perform.
2. **Subcontractor Selection Criteria:** Specify that Atlassian will select subcontractors based on their ability to meet certain standards, such as compliance with laws and regulations, data security, and quality of services.
3. **Subcontractor Performance Monitoring:** Require Atlassian to monitor subcontractor performance and ensure that they meet the agreed-upon standards.
4. **Subcontractor Termination:** Establish procedures for terminating subcontractors in the event of non-compliance or poor performance.
5. **Transparency of Subcontractor Chains:** Include a clause requiring Atlassian to maintain a transparent subcontracting chain, including disclosure of all subcontractors involved in the performance of its obligations under the agreement.

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates): ""Atlassian may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in part) without Customer’s consent.""

**Validation:**

The extracted terms suggest that Atlassian may use subcontractors or Affiliates to perform its obligations under the Agreement, but it remains responsible for ensuring that these subcontractors have the necessary agreements in place to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations. However, the terms do not explicitly require notification to the Customer or a risk assessment of the changes in the subcontracting chain.

**Recommendations:**

To enhance compliance, I recommend including the following notification and evaluation clauses:

1. **Notification Clause:** Add a clause that requires Atlassian to notify the Customer in writing at least 30 days prior to any changes in the subcontracting chain, including the identity of the new subcontractor or Affiliate.
2. **Risk Assessment Clause:** Include a clause that requires Atlassian to conduct a risk assessment of the new subcontractor or Affiliate and to provide the results of the assessment to the Customer. The risk assessment should cover the following:
	* The subcontractor's or Affiliate's experience and qualifications
	* Their ability to meet the requirements of the Agreement
	* Any potential conflicts of interest or security risks
