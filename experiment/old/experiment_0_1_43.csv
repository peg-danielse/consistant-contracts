 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","**Compliance Finding:**
The contract does not explicitly address the assessment of the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider.

**Extracted Clauses:**
Article 29, Preliminary assessment of ICT concentration risk at entity level, mentions that financial entities shall take into account whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to ICT services supporting critical or important functions would lead to any of the following:

* Contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable (Article 29, point (a))
* Having in place multiple contractual arrangements in relation to the provision of ICT services supporting critical or important functions with the same ICT third-party service provider or with closely connected ICT third-party service providers (Article 29, point (b))

However, these clauses do not provide specific criteria for determining substitutability.

**Gap Identification:**
The contract does not provide a clear framework for assessing the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider, which is a critical aspect of managing concentration risk.

**Recommendation:**
The contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider, such as defining criteria for determining substitutability, to ensure that financial entities can effectively manage concentration risk and ensure business continuity."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","The contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability of ICT third-party service providers. While it mentions the need to assess the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, it does not provide clear guidelines on how to evaluate substitutability.

To address this gap, possible benchmarks based on industry standards could be considered, such as:

* Technical compatibility: Assessing whether the new provider's technology is compatible with the existing infrastructure and systems.
* Operational complexity: Evaluating the ease of transition, including the number of changes required to the existing systems and processes.
* Cost: Comparing the costs of the new provider with the existing provider, including any potential savings or additional expenses.
* Ease of transition: Assessing the time and effort required to transition to the new provider, including any potential disruptions to business operations.

To strengthen the contract, it would be beneficial to add measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

* The new provider must have a minimum of 95% technical compatibility with the existing infrastructure and systems.
* The transition to the new provider must not exceed 6 months and must not result in any significant disruptions to business operations.
* The cost of the new provider must be within 10% of the existing provider's costs, with a minimum of 5% savings.
* The new provider must have a proven track record of successful transitions, with a minimum of 3 similar projects completed within the past 2 years.

By incorporating these measurable criteria, the contract would provide a clearer understanding of what constitutes substitutability and would enable more informed decision-making."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract requires financial entities to consider alternative solutions, such as using different ICT third-party service providers, when assessing ICT concentration risk at entity level.

**Specific Clauses:**

* Article 29, Section 1(a): Financial entities shall weigh the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, such as the use of different ICT third-party service providers.
* Article 29, Section 1(b): Financial entities shall weigh benefits and risks that may arise in connection with subcontracting, including the use of alternative ICT subcontractors.

**Documentation Requirements:**

* The contract does not require financial entities to maintain a list of alternative ICT third-party service providers or subcontractors.
* There is no specific requirement to document the results of the market scan or the alternative solutions considered.
* The contract only requires financial entities to ""weigh"" the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, without specifying the need for documentation.

**Missing Documentation Requirements:**

* The contract should require financial entities to document the results of the market scan, including the alternative solutions considered and the benefits and costs associated with each.
* The contract should specify the frequency of the market scan and the documentation requirements for alternative solutions.

**Recommendation:** Include a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative ICT third-party service providers and subcontractors. This will ensure that financial entities have a clear understanding of their ICT concentration risk and can take proactive steps to mitigate it."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","**Compliance Confirmation:** Article 29 of the provided document requires financial entities to perform a preliminary assessment of ICT concentration risk at entity level, which involves weighing the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, such as using different ICT third-party service providers, taking into account if and how envisaged solutions match the business needs and objectives set out in their digital resilience strategy.

**Compliance Analysis:** The cost-benefit analysis required by Article 29 considers financial factors, as it involves weighing the costs of alternative solutions against the benefits of using a particular ICT third-party service provider. However, it does not explicitly consider operational and strategic factors, such as the potential impact on business continuity, customer relationships, and long-term strategic goals.

**Recommendation:** To ensure comprehensive risk management, I recommend adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses that consider financial, operational, and strategic factors. This would enable financial entities to maintain strategic flexibility and make informed decisions about their ICT service providers."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires financial entities to weigh the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, such as the use of different ICT third-party service providers, taking into account if and how envisaged solutions match the business needs and objectives set out in their digital resilience strategy.

**Extracted Provision:** Article 29, Section 1, Point (a) states: ""When performing the identification and assessment of risks referred to in Article 28(4), point (c), financial entities shall also take into account whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to ICT services supporting critical or important functions would lead to any of the following: (a) contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable...""

**Validation:** This provision requires financial entities to consider the substitutability of ICT third-party service providers, which implies a need to maintain awareness of market alternatives. However, the provision does not explicitly mention the need for periodic market research or reviews.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. This could be achieved by inserting a new clause, such as:

""Financial entities shall conduct periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives and assess their potential impact on the financial entity's digital resilience strategy. These reviews shall be conducted at least once every 12 months and shall consider factors such as market trends, technological advancements, and competitor offerings.""

This additional provision would ensure that financial entities remain aware of market alternatives and can make informed decisions about their ICT service providers."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","**Compliance Requirement:**

The contract requires financial entities to assess existing arrangements with the same ICT third-party service provider for ICT services supporting critical or important functions. This assessment must consider the possibility of subcontracting and the effective enforcement of law in the third country where the provider is established.

**Assessment Requirements:**

The contract specifies that financial entities must assess the following aspects of existing arrangements with the same provider:

* Whether the provider is not easily substitutable
* Whether multiple contractual arrangements with the same provider or closely connected providers exist
* The possibility of subcontracting, including the number of subcontractors and their locations
* The insolvency law provisions that would apply in the event of the provider's bankruptcy
* The constraints on recovering financial entity data in the event of the provider's bankruptcy
* Compliance with Union data protection rules
* The effective enforcement of law in the third country where the provider is established

**Gaps:**

The contract does not explicitly require financial entities to assess the number, type, and scope of existing arrangements with the same provider. However, it does require an assessment of the provider's substitutability and the possibility of subcontracting, which may indirectly involve assessing the scope and number of arrangements.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure comprehensive compliance, it is recommended that financial entities include periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the same provider in their risk assessment and management processes. This should involve reviewing the number, type, and scope of arrangements, as well as the provider's substitutability and subcontracting arrangements."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","**Compliance Finding:** The contract requires financial entities to assess the risks associated with ICT concentration, including the use of closely connected providers.

**Provision Identification:** Article 29, Section 1(a) states that financial entities must take into account whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to ICT services would lead to contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable.

**Relationship Identification and Documentation:** Upon reviewing the contract, I did not find any specific provisions requiring the identification and documentation of closely connected providers. This is a critical oversight, as financial entities need to assess the risks associated with these relationships to ensure compliance with the regulations.

**Recommendation:** To address this finding, I suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers in the contract. This can be achieved by adding a clause that requires financial entities to:

* Identify and document all closely connected providers used for ICT services
* Assess the risks associated with these relationships, including the potential for concentration and substitution
* Develop a plan to mitigate these risks and ensure business continuity in the event of a provider failure or substitution

**Flagged Provision:** Article 29, Section 1(a) should be flagged for review and updated to include the above requirements."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","**Compliance Statement:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires financial entities to evaluate and assess the concentration risk of relying on a single ICT third-party service provider for multiple services, which may pose a threat to their digital resilience.

**Clause Identification:** Article 29 of the European Union's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is referenced in the contract, specifically clauses 1(a) and 1(b), which mandate the evaluation of concentration risk. Clause 1(a) states that financial entities must consider whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement with an ICT third-party service provider would lead to contracting a non-substitutable provider, while clause 1(b) requires the evaluation of multiple contractual arrangements with the same or closely connected ICT third-party service providers.

**Tracking Dependency:** The contract does not explicitly require tracking dependency on the provider, but rather focuses on the assessment of concentration risk. However, clause 1(a) mentions the need to weigh the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, including the use of different ICT third-party service providers, which implies that financial entities should consider the potential risks associated with relying on a single provider.

**Recommendation:** Given the importance of evaluating concentration risks, I recommend adding a section to the contract that explicitly requires financial entities to analyze and address these risks. This could include:

* Conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential concentration risks
* Developing strategies to mitigate these risks, such as diversifying service providers or implementing backup systems
* Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of these strategies on a regular basis

By including this section, the contract can provide a clear framework for financial entities to manage concentration risks and ensure the resilience of their digital operations."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","**Compliance Assessment: Interdependencies between Third-Party Services**

Upon reviewing the provided document, it appears that there are no explicit provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. However, the document does mention the need to consider the impact of subcontracting on the ability to fully monitor the contracted functions and the ability of the competent authority to effectively supervise the financial entity (Article 29, Section 2.1).

**Extracted Clauses:**

* Article 29, Section 2.1: ""Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions provide for subcontracting, financial entities shall assess whether and how potentially long or complex chains of subcontracting may impact their ability to fully monitor the contracted functions and the ability of the competent authority to effectively supervise the financial entity in that respect.""

**Recommendation:**

Given the absence of explicit provisions assessing interdependencies between services, it is recommended to suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This can be achieved by adding a clause to the contract that requires the third-party provider to conduct an assessment of the potential risks associated with interdependent services and to implement measures to mitigate these risks."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk, which is a critical aspect of ensuring digital resilience.

**Gap Analysis:** Article 29 of the European Union's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) emphasizes the importance of assessing ICT concentration risk at the entity level. This includes evaluating whether the use of a single ICT third-party service provider could lead to a monopoly or limited alternatives, which could compromise the entity's digital resilience.

**Validation:** While this provision mentions the need to consider ICT concentration risk, it does not specify a regular assessment schedule. The assessment is only mentioned in the context of identifying and assessing risks, without a clear requirement for periodic reviews.

**Recommendation:** To maintain operational resilience, it is essential to include a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments. I recommend adding a clause similar to the following:

""Financial entities shall conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of the ICT third-party provider at least annually, or as otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations. The assessment shall identify and evaluate critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider and shall be used to inform decisions regarding the continuation of the contractual arrangement.""

This clause ensures that the financial entity regularly evaluates the critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider and takes necessary steps to mitigate or manage those risks."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","Upon reviewing the contract, I have identified that it does not explicitly specify risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. The contract mentions that financial entities shall ""weigh the benefits and costs of alternative solutions"" in case of ICT concentration risk, but it does not provide specific guidance on what measures should be taken to mitigate such risks.

Furthermore, the contract does not mention contingency plans, redundancies, or alternative providers as potential risk mitigation measures. This gap in the contract may leave financial entities uncertain about how to address critical risks, potentially exposing them to undue risk.

To address this gap, I suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. For example, the contract could specify that financial entities should develop and implement contingency plans for ICT service disruptions, including procedures for switching to alternative providers or implementing redundancies. This would provide clarity and guidance on how to manage critical risks, ultimately enhancing the overall resilience of financial entities."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies.","**Compliance Assessment: Technological Lock-in Risks**

As a compliance officer, I have identified the need to assess technological lock-in risks in the Atlassian Customer Agreement. Upon reviewing the document, I found the following provisions addressing this issue:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not ""reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Products."" This provision aims to prevent Customer from accessing proprietary technologies, which could lead to technological lock-in.
* Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. This provision could help identify potential lock-in risks and encourage Customer to evaluate their dependence on Atlassian's proprietary technologies.
* Section 10.3 (Return Policy) allows Customer to terminate the Subscription Term and receive a refund within 30 days of its initial Order for a Product. While this provision does not directly address lock-in risks, it provides a potential exit strategy for Customer.

However, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies. This could include:

* A provision that requires Atlassian to provide Customer with information about the proprietary technologies used in the Products, including the potential risks of lock-in.
* A clause that outlines the procedures for switching providers or transitioning to alternative technologies in case of a change in circumstances or a decision to exit the agreement.
* A requirement for Atlassian to provide support and resources to help Customer transition to alternative technologies or providers.

By incorporating these provisions, the agreement can better address the risks of technological lock-in and provide a more comprehensive framework for managing vendor relationships."

**Example Provision:**

""Customer shall disclose to Atlassian any proprietary technology dependencies, including but not limited to custom software, unique configurations, or exclusive systems, prior to implementation. Customer shall maintain accurate records of proprietary technology dependencies and their impact on this Agreement. Atlassian reserves the right to evaluate and document proprietary technology dependencies and may require additional support or resources to ensure compliance with this Agreement."""
"Look for terms requiring the provider to evaluate how technological changes (e.g., updates, upgrades, deprecations) might impact the substitutability of services or systems. Verify whether assessments include risks to operational continuity.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend including clauses for periodic evaluation of how technological changes affect continuity and substitutability.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there is a compliance gap in terms of evaluating how technological changes might impact the substitutability of services or systems. Specifically, Section 2.1 of the Agreement states that Atlassian will grant Customer a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Products and related Support or Advisory Services, but there is no explicit requirement for Atlassian to evaluate how technological changes, such as updates, upgrades, or deprecations, might impact the substitutability of services or systems.

Furthermore, while Section 2.2 of the Agreement requires Atlassian to provide Support and Advisory Services, there is no mention of assessing the risks to operational continuity associated with technological changes. This gap is concerning, as it may leave Customer vulnerable to disruptions in service or system downtime due to unforeseen technological changes.

To address this compliance gap, I recommend including clauses in the Agreement that require Atlassian to periodically evaluate how technological changes affect continuity and substitutability. This could include regular assessments of the potential impact of updates, upgrades, or deprecations on the Products and related Support or Advisory Services, as well as the development of contingency plans to mitigate any risks to operational continuity."
"Search for clauses requiring an assessment of resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations. Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding requirements to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration.","**Compliance Assessment: Resource Concentration Risks**

Upon reviewing the provided document, it appears that there are no explicit clauses requiring an assessment of resource concentration risks. However, Article 29 of the document does mention the importance of considering ICT concentration risks at entity level, specifically when contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable (Article 29, Section 1(a)). This implies that financial entities should evaluate the potential risks associated with relying on a single provider for critical or important functions.

**Extracted Provision:**

Article 29, Section 1(a): ""When performing the identification and assessment of risks referred to in Article 28(4), point (c), financial entities shall also take into account whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to ICT services supporting critical or important functions would lead to any of the following: (a) contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable...""

**Validation:**

The extracted provision does not explicitly require an assessment of resource concentration risks, but rather mentions the importance of considering ICT concentration risks when contracting with a third-party service provider. To address this, I recommend adding requirements to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration, such as:

* Conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential concentration risks
* Developing strategies to mitigate or diversify reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations
* Establishing thresholds for acceptable concentration levels
* Regularly reviewing and updating concentration risk assessments to ensure alignment with changing business needs and requirements

The contract between Atlassian and the Customer does not explicitly address the risk of shared resources, such as multi-tenancy in cloud environments or shared personnel across multiple clients. However, Section 2.1 of the contract states that Atlassian grants the Customer a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Products and related Support and Advisory Services for its and its Affiliates' internal business purposes. This implies that Atlassian may utilize shared resources to provide services to multiple clients, including the Customer.

**Mitigation Measures**

While the contract does not specify measures to mitigate the risks associated with shared resources, it does mention that Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Products, when and as provided by Atlassian, are free of any viruses, malware, or similar malicious code (Section 11.1). Additionally, Section 4.2 requires Atlassian to maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

**Recommendation**

To mitigate the risks associated with shared resources, it is recommended that the contract include assessments of shared resource dependencies and specify mitigation strategies, such as dedicated resources. This would provide the Customer with greater assurance that Atlassian has taken steps to minimize the risks associated with shared resources and protect their data and interests."

This clause implies that financial entities should conduct risk assessments, but it does not specify the frequency, scope, or required documentation.

2. Article 29, Section 2: ""Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions include the possibility that an ICT third-party service provider further subcontracts ICT services supporting a critical or important function to other ICT third-party service providers, financial entities shall weigh benefits and risks that may arise in connection with such subcontracting..."".

This clause mentions the importance of considering subcontracting risks, but it does not specify how often or in what detail these risks should be assessed.

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry best practices, I recommend adding a term to the contract that specifies periodic risk evaluations. Here is a suggested term:

""**Regular Critical Risk Assessments:** The parties agree to conduct regular critical risk assessments at least [insert frequency, e.g., quarterly or annually] to identify and mitigate ICT concentration risks. These assessments shall include:

* A review of the contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers;
* An evaluation of the risks associated with subcontracting;
* An assessment of the ICT services supporting critical or important functions;
* A consideration of the potential impact of ICT concentration risks on the financial entity's operations and reputation.

The parties shall maintain documentation of these risk assessments, including:

* A written report detailing the findings and recommendations;
* A record of the steps taken to mitigate identified risks;
* A review of the effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures.

The parties shall share the results of these risk assessments with each other and work together to implement any necessary changes to the contractual arrangements or risk mitigation measures.""

**Extracted Clauses:**

1. **Section 5.2. License Verification**: Atlassian reserves the right to audit the customer's use of the Software Products to ensure compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. This clause may be seen as a way to monitor and control the customer's usage, potentially limiting their ability to exit the agreement.
2. **Section 10.1. Fees**: The agreement specifies that fees are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in the agreement. This clause may limit the customer's ability to exit the agreement without incurring significant costs.
3. **Section 10.3. Return Policy**: The customer may terminate the subscription within 30 days of the initial order and receive a refund. However, this clause is limited to the initial order and does not provide a clear exit strategy for customers who have been using the products for an extended period.
4. **Section 12.2. Termination for Convenience**: The customer may terminate the agreement at any time, but this clause does not provide a clear process for exiting the agreement or recovering data.

**Suggested Additions:**

1. **Exit Strategy**: Consider adding a clause that outlines a clear process for customers to exit the agreement, including a notice period, data recovery procedures, and any applicable fees.
2. **Data Portability**: Add a clause that ensures customers have access to their data in a portable format, making it easier for them to transfer their data to alternative products or services.
3. **Interoperability**: Include a clause that ensures the products are interoperable with other systems and technologies, reducing the risk of technological lock-in.
4. **Contractual Exclusivity**: Consider adding a clause that limits the duration of contractual exclusivity, ensuring that customers are not locked into a long-term agreement with Atlassian.

**Recommendation:** To mitigate the risk of technological lock-in, Atlassian should consider revising the agreement to include more flexible and customer-friendly provisions, such as a clear exit strategy, data portability, interoperability, and limited contractual exclusivity. This will help ensure that customers have more control over their technology choices and can exit the agreement without significant costs or penalties."

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address shared resource risks associated with multi-tenancy in cloud environments. This omission raises concerns regarding the security, integrity, and availability of customer data.

**Extracted Clauses:**

* Section 4.1: Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.
* Section 4.2: Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.

**Validation:**

While the Agreement mentions Atlassian's security program and measures to protect Customer Data, it does not specifically address shared resource risks associated with multi-tenancy in cloud environments. This is a critical aspect of compliance, as shared resources can pose risks to data security, integrity, and availability.

**Recommendation:**

To address shared resource risks, I suggest adding a requirement for dedicated resources or impact assessments to the Agreement. This could be achieved by:

* Adding a clause that requires Atlassian to provide dedicated resources or infrastructure for customer data, ensuring isolation from other customers' data.
* Including a provision for impact assessments to be conducted by Atlassian in the event of a shared resource risk, to identify and mitigate potential threats to customer data.
* Requiring Atlassian to provide regular security updates and patches for shared resources, to ensure the continued security and integrity of customer data.

**Example Clause:**

""4.3 Shared Resource Risks: Atlassian shall provide dedicated resources or infrastructure for Customer Data, ensuring isolation from other customers' data. In the event of a shared resource risk, Atlassian shall conduct an impact assessment to identify and mitigate potential threats to Customer Data. Regular security updates and patches shall be provided for shared resources to ensure the continued security and integrity of Customer Data."""

**Key Findings:**

1. Section 2.1 of the Agreement mentions that Atlassian grants Customer a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Products and related Support and Advisory Services for its and its Affiliates' internal business purposes. However, it does not explicitly mention BCDR plans or operational resilience measures.
2. Section 4.2 of the Agreement refers to Atlassian's security program, which includes independent third-party audits and certifications. While this demonstrates a commitment to security, it does not explicitly address BCDR plans or operational resilience measures for critical functions.
3. Section 12.4 of the Agreement mentions that upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation. However, it does not address the continuity of critical functions during a disaster or outage.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure compliance with DORA, I recommend adding a clause to the Agreement that explicitly addresses BCDR plans and operational resilience measures for critical functions. This clause should:

1. Require Atlassian to implement and maintain a BCDR plan that ensures the continuity of critical functions during a disaster or outage.
2. Specify the measures that Atlassian will take to ensure operational resilience, including regular testing and review of the BCDR plan.
3. Require Atlassian to provide regular updates to Customer on the status of the BCDR plan and any changes or updates made to it.

**Example Clause:**

""Atlassian shall implement and maintain a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plan that ensures the continuity of critical functions during a disaster or outage. The BCDR plan shall include measures to ensure operational resilience, including regular testing and review of the plan. Atlassian shall provide regular updates to Customer on the status of the BCDR plan and any changes or updates made to it.""

Clause Extraction: There is no specific clause in the contract that outlines RTOs and RPOs for critical services. However, Section 4.5 (Data Retrieval) mentions that the Documentation describes how Customer may retrieve its Customer Data from the Cloud Products, but it does not provide any information on RTOs and RPOs.

Measurability: The absence of RTOs and RPOs makes it challenging to measure the performance of Atlassian's critical services, which can lead to difficulties in identifying potential issues and implementing corrective actions.

Recommendation: To ensure compliance with business continuity and data integrity requirements, it is recommended that the contract be amended to include specific RTOs and RPOs for critical services. This can be achieved by adding a clause that outlines the expected RTOs and RPOs for services such as data backup and recovery, system availability, and disaster recovery. For example:

""Critical Services RTOs and RPOs:

**Extracted Clauses:**

1. Section 11.1 (Performance Warranties): Atlassian warrants that the Products will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation during the applicable Subscription Term. However, this warranty does not specify a root cause analysis process in case of non-conformity.
2. Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification): Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. This clause does not explicitly mention root cause analysis for resolving infringement claims.
3. Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws): Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. While this clause emphasizes compliance with laws, it does not explicitly require root cause analysis for incidents.

**Recommendations:**

1. Include a root cause analysis process in Section 11.1 (Performance Warranties) to ensure that Atlassian conducts a thorough investigation to identify and address the underlying cause of non-conformity.
2. Specify a root cause analysis process in Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) to enable Atlassian to effectively resolve infringement claims and prevent future occurrences.
3. Consider adding a root cause analysis clause in Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) to ensure that parties conduct a thorough investigation to identify and address any regulatory non-compliance.

**Timelines and Responsibilities:**

While the extracted clauses do not specify explicit timelines and responsibilities for root cause analysis, it is recommended that Atlassian establish clear procedures and timelines for conducting root cause analysis in case of incidents. This may include:

* Identifying the incident and initiating the root cause analysis process within a specified timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours)
* Assembling a team to conduct the root cause analysis, including representatives from relevant departments (e.g., product development, quality assurance, and customer support)
* Documenting the root cause analysis process and findings
* Implementing corrective actions to address the underlying cause of the incident
* Reviewing and updating procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future"
Corrective Actions:Search for provisions mandating corrective actions based on root cause findings. Extract details on timelines and scope. Flag gaps if corrective action requirements are missing.,"Compliance Review: Corrective Actions Provisions

The Atlassian Customer Agreement contains provisions mandating corrective actions based on root cause findings, primarily in the context of security incidents and compliance with laws and regulations. Article 4.2 (Security Program) requires Atlassian to implement and maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. Additionally, Article 15.4 (Mitigation) requires Atlassian to take corrective actions in response to an actual or potential Infringement Claim, including procuring rights for Customer's continued use of the Products, replacing or modifying the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminating the affected Subscription Term.

However, a gap is identified in the provision of timelines for corrective actions. While Article 4.2 (Security Program) requires Atlassian to implement and maintain a security program, it does not specify a timeframe for corrective actions in the event of a security incident. Similarly, Article 15.4 (Mitigation) does not provide a specific timeline for corrective actions in response to an Infringement Claim.

To address this gap, Atlassian should consider adding provisions that specify timelines for corrective actions, including:

* A timeframe for implementing corrective actions in response to a security incident, such as within 24 hours or 72 hours
* A deadline for completing corrective actions in response to an Infringement Claim, such as within 30 days or 60 days
* A process for regularly reviewing and updating the security program to ensure it remains effective and compliant with relevant laws and regulations

By including these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that corrective actions are taken in a timely and effective manner, reducing the risk of security incidents and compliance issues."

As for the financial entity's right to access this information, the contract does not explicitly grant them the right to access the names and roles of subcontractors or the subcontracting structure. Article 29 only requires the financial entity to perform a preliminary assessment of ICT concentration risk at entity level, which includes taking into account whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to ICT services supporting critical or important functions would lead to any of the following: (a) contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable; or (b) having in place multiple contractual arrangements in relation to the provision of ICT services supporting critical or important functions with the same ICT third-party service provider or with closely connected ICT third-party service providers.

Missing Transparency Provisions:

The contract lacks explicit provisions requiring the provider to disclose the following information:

* Names and roles of all subcontractors
* Changes to the subcontracting structure

To address this issue, the contract should be amended to include clauses mandating full disclosure of subcontracting chains, including:

* A requirement for the provider to disclose the names and roles of all subcontractors involved in the provision of ICT services
* A requirement for the provider to notify the financial entity of any changes to the subcontracting structure
* A right for the financial entity to access this information to ensure effective monitoring and supervision of the contracted functions

**Suggested Additions:** To mitigate potential risks, I recommend adding the following restrictions or conditions to the agreement:

* Section 5.2 License Verification: Add a clause specifying that Atlassian will not subcontract any critical functions or services that require access to Customer Data or sensitive information.
* Section 5.3 Number of Instances: Consider adding a clause limiting the number of instances or systems on which Software Products can be installed, to prevent unauthorized subcontracting or use.
* Section 7.2 Third-Party Products: Add a clause specifying that Atlassian will not subcontract any services or functions related to third-party products, or that Customer must approve any subcontracting arrangements in writing.
* New Section: Consider adding a clause that explicitly prohibits Atlassian from subcontracting any critical functions or services without Customer's prior written consent, and that requires Atlassian to maintain a list of subcontractors and their roles and responsibilities.

* Benefits and costs of alternative solutions
* Business needs and objectives
* Digital resilience strategy

The Atlassian Customer Agreement (Section 2.1) states that financial entities must perform a preliminary assessment of ICT concentration risk at entity level, which includes evaluating the length and complexity of subcontracting chains. Specifically, clause 2.1 requires entities to assess whether and how potentially long or complex chains of subcontracting may impact their ability to fully monitor the contracted functions and the ability of the competent authority to effectively supervise the financial entity in that respect.

References to the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion are not explicitly mentioned in the provided clauses. However, it can be inferred that the complexity of subcontracting chains is a key consideration, as stated in clause 2.1. To strengthen this requirement, it is suggested that the clause be modified to include specific language referencing the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion, for example:

""Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions provide for subcontracting, financial entities shall assess whether and how potentially long or complex chains of subcontracting, including those involving more than 3 tiers of subcontractors or subcontractors located in more than 2 different countries, may impact their ability to fully monitor the contracted functions and the ability of the competent authority to effectively supervise the financial entity in that respect.""

**Recommendations:**
To address this compliance gap, I recommend that Atlassian includes the following monitoring mechanisms:

1. **Subcontractor Management Process**: Atlassian should establish a formal process to manage subcontractors, including regular audits, risk assessments, and due diligence to ensure that subcontractors meet the required standards.
2. **Chain of Custody Tracking**: Atlassian should implement a tool or process to track the chain of custody for subcontracting chains, ensuring that all subcontractors are properly identified, authorized, and monitored.
3. **Regular Audits and Assessments**: Atlassian should conduct regular audits and assessments of subcontractors to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, security standards, and industry best practices.
4. **Incident Response Plan**: Atlassian should develop an incident response plan to address potential security incidents or breaches related to subcontracting chains, including procedures for notification, containment, and remediation.
5. **Transparency and Communication**: Atlassian should provide transparent and regular communication to customers regarding subcontracting chains, including information on subcontractor identity, location, and performance.
