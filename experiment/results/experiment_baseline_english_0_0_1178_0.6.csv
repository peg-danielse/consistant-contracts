"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have found the following clauses that address the retention of responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Retained Responsibility**

* Section 20.1: ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This clause implies that Atlassian retains responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, including DORA obligations.
* Section 15.5: ""Atlassian’s obligations in this Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) do not apply to the extent an Infringement Claim arises from: ... (c) Third-Party Products, Customer Data or Customer Materials."" This clause suggests that Atlassian is not responsible for Customer's data or materials, implying that the Customer retains responsibility for DORA compliance related to their data.

**References to DORA Obligations**

* There are no explicit references to DORA obligations in the agreement. However, Section 20.1 mentions compliance with all applicable laws, which would include DORA obligations.

**Non-Transfer of Compliance Obligations**

* Section 20.3(a): ""Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian’s prior written consent."" This clause implies that Customer cannot transfer their compliance obligations to Atlassian, and therefore retains responsibility for DORA compliance.

**Acknowledgment that Outsourcing Doesn't Diminish Entity's Responsibility**

* Section 20.11: ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This clause acknowledges that Atlassian may outsource certain tasks, but retains responsibility for ensuring compliance with DORA obligations.

In conclusion, while the agreement does not explicitly state that Atlassian retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, the clauses mentioned above imply that:

* Atlassian retains responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, including DORA obligations.
* Customer retains responsibility for DORA compliance related to their data.
* Customer cannot transfer their compliance obligations to Atlassian.
* Atlassian's outsourcing of tasks does not diminish its responsibility for ensuring compliance with DORA obligations."

While the agreement mentions the importance of monitoring and reporting, the scope, frequency, and metrics for performance evaluation are not explicitly outlined.

**Monitoring Scope:**
The agreement does not clearly define the scope of monitoring, leaving room for interpretation. It is unclear what aspects of the provider's performance will be monitored, such as the quality of services, response times, or customer satisfaction.

**Frequency Requirements:**
There are no specific frequency requirements for monitoring, which may lead to inconsistent or sporadic monitoring efforts. The agreement does not specify whether monitoring should occur on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually, or only in response to specific events.

**Performance Metrics:**
The agreement does not outline specific performance metrics that will be used to evaluate the provider's performance. This lack of clarity may make it challenging to determine whether the provider is meeting its obligations.

**Reporting Obligations:**
The agreement does not specify the reporting obligations of the provider, including the format, frequency, and content of reports. This may lead to inconsistent or incomplete reporting, making it difficult to assess the provider's performance.

**Recommendation:**
To address these gaps, I recommend implementing a structured ongoing monitoring framework that includes:

1. Clearly defining the scope of monitoring to ensure all relevant aspects of the provider's performance are evaluated.

However, I do have some observations and recommendations for improvement.

The contract is divided into 21 sections, which are clearly organized and follow a logical sequence. The sections are well-defined, and each one addresses a specific aspect of the agreement. The use of headings, subheadings, and bullet points makes the contract easy to navigate and understand.

The contract also includes a definition of terms in Section 21, which provides a clear explanation of key terms used throughout the agreement. This is a good practice, as it helps to avoid ambiguity and ensures that both parties understand the meaning of the terms used.

Regarding cross-referencing, the contract does a good job of referencing other sections and documents, such as the Product-Specific Terms, Policies, and Data Processing Addendum (DPA). This helps to ensure that all relevant information is easily accessible and that the parties are aware of their obligations and responsibilities.

However, I do recommend adding a table of contents to the contract, which would provide a clear and concise overview of the sections and their corresponding page numbers. This would make it easier for parties to quickly locate specific sections and clauses.

Additionally, I suggest adding signature blocks and dates to the contract, which would provide a clear record of when the agreement was signed and by whom. This is an essential element of any contract, as it provides evidence of the parties' intent to be bound by the agreement.

Overall, the Atlassian Customer Agreement is well-structured and effectively communicates the terms and conditions of the agreement. However, with a few minor adjustments, it could be even more effective and easier to navigate.
