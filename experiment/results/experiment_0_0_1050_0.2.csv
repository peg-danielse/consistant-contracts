"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clause that addresses the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Section 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

This clause is a general statement that requires both parties to comply with applicable laws, including DORA obligations. However, it does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance.

**Section 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates**

""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

This clause acknowledges that Atlassian may use subcontractors or Affiliates, but it does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. However, it does imply that the financial entity is responsible for ensuring that Atlassian meets its obligations under the agreement.

**Section 20.1: Compliance with Laws** (again)

This clause is repeated in the section on ""Government End-Users"" (Section 20.14), which states:

""If Customer is a United States federal, state or local government customer, this Agreement is subject to, and is varied by, the Government Amendment available at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/government-amendment.""

The Government Amendment is not explicitly mentioned in the main agreement, but it is likely to include DORA obligations. However, this clause does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance.

**Conclusion**

While the agreement does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, it does imply that the financial entity is responsible for ensuring that Atlassian meets its obligations under the agreement. Additionally, the general statement in Section 20.1: Compliance with Laws requires both parties to comply with applicable laws, including DORA obligations. However, it is recommended that the financial entity reviews the agreement in its entirety and consults with a compliance expert to ensure that it meets its DORA obligations."

Upon reviewing the contract, it is clear that Atlassian, the financial entity, has retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. The contract comprehensively covers various financial services regulations, including tax laws, export restrictions, and government end-user requirements. Specifically, Section 20.2 (Compliance with Laws) states that Atlassian must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. Additionally, Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) explicitly requires Atlassian to comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products.

**Compliance Findings:**

1. **Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations**: The contract covers various financial services regulations, including tax laws, export restrictions, and government end-user requirements.
2. **Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities**: Atlassian has retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws, with no delegation of regulatory responsibilities to third parties.

4. **References to specific financial services laws**: The contract references specific financial services laws, including tax laws, export restrictions, and government end-user requirements.

**Recommendation:**

While the contract appears to comprehensively cover all applicable financial services laws, it is recommended that an explicit clause be added to cover retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should be included in Section 20.2 (Compliance with Laws) and should read:

""20.2.1. Retention of Regulatory Responsibilities: Atlassian retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws and regulations, including but not limited to, tax laws, export restrictions, and government end-user requirements. Atlassian shall comply with all such laws and regulations in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

 • Renewal approval processes
 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as governance gap and recommend adding explicit board/senior management approval requirements.","**Compliance Finding:** Senior management or board approval is required for ICT service agreements to ensure that the organization's strategic objectives and risk tolerance are aligned with the agreements.

**Provisions Review:**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following provisions related to approval requirements:

* Section 20.3 (Assignment) states that Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without Atlassian's prior written consent. However, there is no explicit requirement for senior management or board approval for such assignments.
* Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement) mentions that Atlassian may modify this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications will become effective during the then-current Subscription Term. However, there is no provision for senior management or board approval of these modifications.
* Section 20.10 (Force Majeure) states that neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement due to events beyond its reasonable control. However, there is no provision for senior management or board approval of force majeure events.

**Governance Gap:** The absence of explicit senior management or board approval requirements for ICT service agreements, including assignments, modifications, and force majeure events, creates a governance gap.

**Recommendation:** To address this governance gap, I recommend adding explicit board/senior management approval requirements for the following:

1. Assignments: Require senior management or board approval for any assignments or transfers of rights or obligations under the Agreement.
2. Modifications: Establish a process for senior management or board approval of any modifications to the Agreement, including changes to the scope of work, pricing, or terms and conditions.
3. Force Majeure Events: Develop a process for senior management or board approval of force majeure events, including the identification of such events and the implementation of mitigation strategies.

**Documentation:** To ensure compliance with these recommendations, I suggest maintaining a record of all approvals, including:

1. Assignment approvals: Document the date, time, and details of each assignment approval, including the names of the approving individuals and the reasons for approval.
2. Modification approvals: Maintain a record of all modification approvals, including the date, time, and details of each approval, as well as the changes made to the Agreement.
3. Force Majeure Event approvals: Document the date, time, and details of each force majeure event approval, including the identification of the event and the mitigation strategies implemented.

By implementing these recommendations, the organization can ensure that senior management and the board are informed and involved in the approval process for ICT service agreements, reducing the risk of non-compliance and ensuring that the organization's strategic objectives and risk tolerance are aligned with the agreements."

Follow-up if Missing: Suggest adding structured monitoring requirements with specific timelines and metrics.","Compliance Review: Third-Party Arrangements Monitoring Requirements

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require ongoing board/senior management monitoring of third-party arrangements. However, Section 7.2 (Third-Party Products) mentions that Customer's use of Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider. This implies that Customer should have some level of oversight and monitoring in place to ensure compliance with this arrangement.

To address this gap, I recommend adding structured monitoring requirements with specific timelines and metrics to ensure that Customer's third-party arrangements are properly managed. This could include:

* Regular review of third-party contracts and agreements to ensure compliance with Customer's requirements and Atlassian's terms
* Quarterly or bi-annual monitoring of third-party performance and data access to ensure that Customer Data is being handled securely and in accordance with Customer's policies

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding detailed system access rights provisions.","Compliance Review: Comprehensive Audit Rights Provisions are Missing.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there are no provisions granting comprehensive audit rights over systems. This is a significant compliance concern, as it may limit the ability of Atlassian to conduct thorough audits and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

To address this issue, I recommend adding detailed system access rights provisions to the agreement. This should include:

* Scope of access: Clearly define what systems and data Atlassian is authorized to access and audit.
* Access conditions: Specify the conditions under which Atlassian may access and audit systems, including any necessary approvals or notifications.
* Notice requirements: Require Atlassian to provide reasonable notice to Customer before conducting an audit, including the scope and timing of the audit.
* Security protocols: Establish protocols for ensuring the security and confidentiality of Customer's systems and data during the audit process.
* Documentation requirements: Require Atlassian to maintain detailed records of all audits, including findings and recommendations.

By including these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that it has the necessary audit rights to maintain compliance with relevant laws and regulations, while also protecting Customer's systems and data."

Upon reviewing the provided document, it appears that Atlassian grants the right to audit processes and procedures to the customer, but with certain limitations and requirements. The audit scope is limited to the customer's use of the Products, and the methodology requirements are not explicitly stated. The customer has access to documentation, but testing permissions are not clearly defined. The report requirements are also not specified.

**Audit Scope:** The audit scope is limited to the customer's use of the Products, which may not be sufficient to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

**Methodology Requirements:** The document does not specify the methodology requirements for the audit, which may lead to inconsistencies and potential disputes.

**Documentation Access:** The customer has access to documentation, but it is unclear what specific documentation is available and how it can be accessed.

**Testing Permissions:** The testing permissions are not clearly defined, which may limit the customer's ability to conduct a thorough audit.

**Report Requirements:** The report requirements are not specified, which may lead to confusion and potential disputes regarding the audit findings.

**Audit Gap:** The current audit rights and processes do not appear to be comprehensive, and the customer may not have sufficient rights to conduct a thorough audit. I suggest adding comprehensive process audit rights to ensure that the customer has the necessary access and permissions to conduct an effective audit.

**Recommendation:** To address the audit gap, I recommend adding the following provisions to the agreement:

* A clear definition of the audit scope, including the specific areas and systems to be audited
* A detailed description of the methodology requirements, including the audit standards and procedures to be followed
* A specification of the documentation that will be made available to the customer, including the format and timing of access
* A clear definition of the testing permissions, including the specific systems and data that can be accessed and tested
* A specification of the report requirements, including the format, content, and timing of the audit report

By adding these provisions, the customer will have more comprehensive audit rights and processes, which will help to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations."
"Search for provisions allowing regulatory body inspections. Look for:

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit regulatory inspection rights.","**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly provide for regulatory body inspections, which may pose a compliance risk.

Upon reviewing the agreement, I found that there are no provisions that specifically address regulatory body inspections. However, Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all applicable laws, which may imply a general obligation to cooperate with regulatory inspections. Nevertheless, this provision is too broad and does not provide specific guidance on the scope of access, notice requirements, cooperation obligations, documentation requirements, or information sharing protocols.

**Recommendation:** To mitigate potential compliance risks, I recommend adding explicit regulatory inspection rights to the agreement. This can be achieved by incorporating a provision that outlines the terms and conditions for regulatory body inspections, including:

* Access scope: Define the specific areas or systems that regulatory bodies may access during an inspection.
* Notice requirements: Specify the notice period and content that Atlassian must provide to Customer before a regulatory body inspection.
* Cooperation obligations: Outline the cooperation requirements for Customer and Atlassian during a regulatory body inspection.
* Documentation requirements: Specify the documentation that Atlassian must provide to regulatory bodies during an inspection.
* Information sharing protocols: Define the protocols for sharing information between Atlassian and regulatory bodies during an inspection.

Example of a revised provision:

""Regulatory Body Inspections:

Atlassian may, at its discretion, allow regulatory bodies to inspect its premises, systems, and records related to the Products and Services. Customer acknowledges and agrees that regulatory bodies may have access to Customer Data and other information related to the Products and Services.

Notice Requirements:

Atlassian will provide Customer with written notice of any regulatory body inspection, including the date, time, and scope of the inspection, at least [insert time period, e.g., 7 days] prior to the inspection.

Cooperation Obligations:

Customer will cooperate fully with regulatory bodies during any inspection, including providing access to Customer Data and other information related to the Products and Services.

Documentation Requirements:

Atlassian will provide regulatory bodies with all necessary documentation and information related to the Products and Services, including Customer Data.

Information Sharing Protocols:

Atlassian will share information with regulatory bodies in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and will ensure that all information shared is accurate and up-to-date.

By incorporating this revised provision, Atlassian can ensure that it is prepared to handle regulatory body inspections and minimize potential compliance risks."""

Follow-up if Missing: Flag as continuity gap and suggest adding comprehensive transition planning requirements.","**Compliance Review: Service Continuity during Transition**

The review of service continuity requirements during transition reveals that a comprehensive transition plan is essential to ensure seamless service delivery. However, upon examination, it appears that the transition plan components, timeline requirements, resource allocation, knowledge transfer, and data migration procedures are not fully defined or documented.

**Transition Plan Components:**

The transition plan should include a detailed description of the transition process, including the scope of work, timelines, and milestones. However, the current plan lacks a clear outline of the transition activities, roles, and responsibilities.

**Timeline Requirements:**

The transition timeline is not clearly defined, and the deadlines for each milestone are not specified. This lack of clarity may lead to delays and disruptions in service delivery.

**Resource Allocation:**

The plan does not specify the resources required for the transition, including personnel, equipment, and budget. This may result in inadequate resources being allocated, leading to delays or poor quality of work.

**Knowledge Transfer:**

The plan does not include a knowledge transfer process to ensure that the new service provider has the necessary information and expertise to deliver the service. This may lead to a disruption in service delivery and potential errors.

**Data Migration Procedures:**

The plan does not specify the data migration procedures, including data validation, testing, and verification. This may result in data loss or corruption during the transition.

**Compliance Gap:**

The lack of comprehensive transition planning requirements creates a continuity gap, which may impact the service delivery and reputation of the organization. To address this gap, I recommend adding the following requirements to the transition plan:

1. Define a detailed transition plan with clear timelines, milestones, and roles and responsibilities.
2. Specify the resources required for the transition, including personnel, equipment, and budget.
3. Develop a knowledge transfer process to ensure that the new service provider has the necessary information and expertise.
4. Define data migration procedures, including data validation, testing, and verification.
5. Establish a communication plan to ensure that all stakeholders are informed and engaged throughout the transition process.

By addressing these compliance gaps, the organization can ensure a smooth transition and maintain service continuity, ultimately protecting its reputation and customer satisfaction."
