"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clauses that address the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Clause 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. This clause implies that the financial entity is responsible for complying with all applicable laws, including DORA obligations.

**Clause 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. This clause does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains responsibility for DORA compliance, but it suggests that Atlassian's use of subcontractors or Affiliates does not diminish its responsibility.

**Clause 15.5: Exceptions**

Atlassian's obligations in this Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) do not apply to the extent an Infringement Claim arises from: (a) Customer's modification or unauthorized use of the Products, (b) use of the Products in combination with items not provided by Atlassian (including Third-Party Products), (c) any unsupported release of the Software Products or Cloud Clients, or (d) Third-Party Products. This clause does not directly address DORA compliance, but it implies that the financial entity is responsible for ensuring that its use of the Products complies with applicable laws and regulations.

**Clause 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

However, I did not find any explicit clauses that clearly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, references to DORA obligations, or non-transfer of compliance obligations. The closest I found was Clause 20.1, which requires each party to comply with all applicable laws, including DORA obligations.

To confirm the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance, I would recommend reviewing the agreement in its entirety and seeking clarification from the relevant parties involved."

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Suggest implementing structured ongoing monitoring framework.","**Compliance Review: Continuous Monitoring of Provider Performance**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is evident that the provider's performance is subject to monitoring, albeit with some limitations. The agreement does not explicitly outline a structured ongoing monitoring framework, which is a critical component of ensuring the provider's compliance with the agreement.

**Monitoring Scope**

The agreement mentions that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. However, this provision only applies to the Software Products and not the Cloud Products. It is unclear whether similar monitoring provisions exist for Cloud Products.

**Frequency Requirements**

The agreement does not specify the frequency of monitoring for either Software Products or Cloud Products. This lack of clarity may lead to inconsistent monitoring, potentially allowing the provider to deviate from the agreed-upon terms.

**Performance Metrics**

The agreement does not explicitly outline the performance metrics that will be used to evaluate the provider's performance. This omission may hinder the effectiveness of monitoring, as it is unclear what specific metrics will be used to assess compliance.

**Reporting Obligations**

The agreement requires Atlassian to provide Customer with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Cloud Products, which outlines service level commitments. However, it is unclear whether similar reporting obligations exist for Software Products or Cloud Products. Furthermore, the agreement does not specify the format or frequency of reporting.

**Recommendation**

To address these gaps, I recommend implementing a structured ongoing monitoring framework that includes:

1. Clear monitoring scope: Define the scope of monitoring for both Software Products and Cloud Products.
2. Regular frequency: Establish a regular monitoring schedule, such as quarterly or bi-annually, to ensure consistent evaluation of the provider's performance.
3. Performance metrics: Identify specific metrics that will be used to evaluate the provider's performance, such as uptime, response times, and error rates.
4. Reporting obligations: Specify the format and frequency of reporting, including the provision of regular progress updates and any necessary notifications.

By implementing a structured ongoing monitoring framework, Customer can ensure that Atlassian's performance is consistently evaluated and that any issues are promptly addressed. This will help maintain a high level of service quality and ensure compliance with the agreement."

"Review the contract to verify presence of complete documentation of all rights and obligations. Look specifically for:
 • Clear delineation of all parties' rights
 • Comprehensive list of obligations
 • Service scope definitions
 • Term and termination provisions
 • Liability and indemnification clauses
 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag any missing essential contract elements and recommend adding comprehensive rights and obligations documentation.","After reviewing the contract, it is clear that the parties have made a concerted effort to document their rights and obligations. However, upon closer inspection, there are a few areas where additional clarity and specificity would be beneficial.

Firstly, the contract does an excellent job of delineating the rights of both parties, particularly in Section 13 (Ownership), where it explicitly states that ""Customer owns all intellectual property and other rights in Customer Data and Customer Materials provided to Atlassian or used with the Products."" This clear delineation of rights helps to prevent potential disputes and ensures that both parties understand their respective roles.

However, there are some areas where the contract could benefit from more comprehensive documentation. For instance, the list of obligations in Section 6 (Customer Obligations) is somewhat general and could be more specific. For example, the contract states that Customer must ""ensure it has made all disclosures and obtained all rights and consents necessary for Atlassian to use Customer Data and Customer Materials to provide the Cloud Products, Support or Advisory Services."" While this is a good start, it would be more effective to provide a more detailed list of specific obligations, such as obtaining consent from data subjects, ensuring data accuracy, and implementing data security measures.

Additionally, the service scope definitions in Section 2 (Use of Products) could be more clearly defined. While the contract provides a general description of the scope of use, it would be more beneficial to provide a more detailed and specific description of the services included in the scope, as well as any limitations or exclusions.

The term and termination provisions in Section 12 (Term and Termination) are clear and well-defined, providing a comprehensive outline of the conditions under which the contract can be terminated. However, it would be beneficial to include a more detailed explanation of the termination process, including notice periods, termination fees, and any other relevant details.

Finally, the liability and indemnification clauses in Section 14 (Limitations of Liability) and Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) are comprehensive and well-defined. However, it would be beneficial to include a more detailed explanation of the indemnification process, including the scope of indemnification, the types of damages that are covered, and any limitations or exclusions.

In conclusion, while the contract does a good job of documenting the rights and obligations of both parties, there are areas where additional clarity and specificity would be beneficial. To address these gaps, I recommend adding the following:

* A more comprehensive list of specific obligations for Customer, including obtaining consent from data subjects, ensuring data accuracy, and implementing data security measures.
* More detailed and specific service scope definitions, including a clear description of the services included in the scope, as well as any limitations or exclusions.
* A more detailed explanation of the termination process, including notice periods, termination fees, and any other relevant details.
* A more detailed explanation of the indemnification process, including the scope of indemnification, the types of damages that are covered, and any limitations or exclusions.

By addressing these gaps, the contract can be made more comprehensive and effective in documenting the rights and obligations of both parties."
