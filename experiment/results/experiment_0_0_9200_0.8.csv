"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","**Compliance Finding:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement explicitly retains the financial entity's responsibility for compliance with DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) obligations. Specifically, Section 20.1 of the Agreement states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business, including regulatory requirements. While DORA is not explicitly mentioned, the language is broad enough to encompass its obligations. Additionally, Section 20.3 (Assignment) indicates that the customer may not assign or transfer its rights or obligations under the Agreement without Atlassian's prior written consent, implying that the customer retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Furthermore, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) clarifies that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance, and the customer is responsible for ensuring that any subcontractors or Affiliates comply with applicable laws, including DORA. Overall, the Agreement makes it clear that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance and cannot outsource this responsibility to Atlassian."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:
 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","**Compliance Review: Retention of Regulatory Responsibilities**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. While the contract mentions payment terms and refund policies, it does not provide comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations, nor does it clearly acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations. Specifically, Section 10.1 (Fees) and Section 10.2 (Taxes) only address payment obligations and tax exemptions, but do not explicitly state that the financial entity (Atlassian) retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws.

To address this gap, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the contract, such as:

**Retention of Regulatory Responsibilities**

Atlassian retains full responsibility for complying with all applicable financial services laws, regulations, and standards, including but not limited to, anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), and financial institution reporting requirements. Atlassian will ensure that all financial transactions and services provided under this Agreement are conducted in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. Customer acknowledges that Atlassian's compliance with financial services laws is its sole responsibility and will not be delegated to Customer.

This clause should be included in the contract to ensure clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations and to prevent any potential delegation of regulatory responsibilities to Customer."

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires explicit senior management or board approval for certain actions related to ICT service agreements. However, the agreement does not specify clear approval requirements, review procedures, or documentation of approvals for senior management or board approval of ICT service agreements.

**Key Findings:**

* Section 20.3 (Assignment) of the Atlassian Customer Agreement requires Customer's prior written consent for assignment of the agreement, which may involve approval from senior management or the board. However, it does not specify who needs to approve the assignment or the process for obtaining approval.
* Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement) requires Atlassian to provide notice of changes to the agreement, but it does not specify whether senior management or the board needs to approve the changes before they take effect.
* There is no provision that requires senior management or board approval for renewals of ICT service agreements, which may involve significant changes to the terms and conditions of the agreement.

**Governance Gap:**

The lack of explicit senior management or board approval requirements for ICT service agreements creates a governance gap that may lead to unauthorized changes to the agreement, unintended exposure of the organization to risks, or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Recommendation:**

To address this governance gap, it is recommended that the organization add explicit board/senior management approval requirements for the following:

* Assignment of the Atlassian Customer Agreement
* Changes to the agreement
* Renewals of ICT service agreements

This can be achieved by adding provisions that specify the approval process, including who needs to approve the changes, the scope of approval, and the documentation requirements for approval."

**Methodology Requirements**: The agreement does not specify the required methodology for the audit, leaving room for interpretation. To ensure consistency and effectiveness, it is suggested to include specific requirements for the audit methodology, such as the use of standard audit tools and procedures.

**Documentation Access**: The agreement grants Atlassian access to Customer's documentation, but it does not specify the extent of access or the documentation that must be provided. To ensure transparency and cooperation, it is recommended to clarify the documentation requirements and the access rights granted to Atlassian.

**Testing Permissions**: The agreement does not address testing permissions, which is a critical aspect of the audit process. To ensure that the audit is thorough and effective, it is suggested to include specific requirements for testing permissions, such as the right to conduct system testing and review of audit logs.

**Report Requirements**: The agreement does not specify the requirements for the audit report, leaving room for interpretation. To ensure that the report is comprehensive and actionable, it is recommended to include specific requirements for the report, such as the inclusion of audit findings, recommendations, and a summary of the audit scope and methodology.

**Comprehensive Process Audit Rights**: Based on the identified gaps and areas for improvement, it is recommended to add comprehensive process audit rights to the agreement. This would include the right to conduct regular audits, access to relevant documentation, and the ability to test systems and review audit logs. By including these rights, Atlassian can ensure that Customer is in compliance with the agreement and regulatory requirements, and that any issues are identified and addressed promptly."

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit regulatory inspection rights.","**Compliance Requirement: Regulatory Body Inspections**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement provides limited provisions for regulatory body inspections, primarily related to data protection and security. However, these provisions are scattered throughout the agreement and lack explicit details on access scope, notice requirements, cooperation obligations, documentation requirements, and information sharing protocols.

**Provisions Found:**

* Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions Atlassian's security practices and procedures, but does not explicitly address regulatory body inspections.
* Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension) allows Atlassian to limit access or remove Customer Data if it may violate Law or the rights of others.
* Section 16 (Confidentiality) requires both parties to keep confidential information secure and not disclose it to third parties, but does not explicitly address regulatory body inspections.
* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all applicable laws, but does not provide specific details on regulatory body inspections.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to provide clarity on regulatory body inspections, I recommend adding explicit provisions to the agreement, including:

* A clear statement on the access scope, including the types of regulatory bodies that may inspect the premises, facilities, or systems.
* Notice requirements, including the timeframe and manner in which the regulatory body must notify Atlassian of the inspection.
* Cooperation obligations, including the level of cooperation Atlassian must provide during the inspection.
* Documentation requirements, including the types of records and documents that must be made available to the regulatory body.
* Information sharing protocols, including the procedures for sharing information with the regulatory body.

**Example Language:**

""The parties acknowledge that regulatory bodies may inspect the premises, facilities, or systems of Atlassian or its subcontractors to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In the event of a regulatory inspection, Atlassian will provide the regulatory body with reasonable access to the premises, facilities, or systems, and will cooperate fully with the inspection. Atlassian will provide the regulatory body with written notice of the inspection at least [insert timeframe] days prior to the inspection, unless prohibited by law. During the inspection, Atlassian will make available all relevant records and documents, including but not limited to [insert specific documentation requirements]. Atlassian will also provide the regulatory body with information and assistance as reasonably requested, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations."""

Follow-up if Missing: Flag as resilience gap and suggest adding comprehensive BCDR requirements.","**Compliance Review: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan Requirements**

The review of the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plan reveals several gaps in the plan components, alignment with operational needs, update frequency, testing requirements, and documentation standards.

**Plan Components:**
The BCDR plan lacks a clear description of the organization's critical business functions, identifying key risks, and outlining procedures for mitigation and recovery. Additionally, the plan does not include a comprehensive inventory of IT systems, data centers, and infrastructure.

**Alignment with Operational Needs:**
The BCDR plan does not adequately align with the organization's operational needs, including a lack of clear roles and responsibilities, inadequate training, and insufficient communication plans.

**Update Frequency:**
The plan has not been updated in the past 12 months, which is a critical oversight, given the rapidly changing business environment.

**Testing Requirements:**
The plan does not include regular testing and exercises to ensure the effectiveness of the BCDR plan.

**Documentation Standards:**
The plan documentation does not meet industry standards, and the language is unclear and ambiguous.

**Resilience Gap:**
The lack of comprehensive BCDR requirements poses a significant resilience gap, as the organization is not adequately prepared to respond to and recover from disruptions.

**Recommendation:**
To address these gaps, I suggest adding comprehensive BCDR requirements, including:

1. Developing a clear and comprehensive BCDR plan that aligns with the organization's operational needs.
2. Conducting regular testing and exercises to ensure the effectiveness of the plan.
3. Updating the plan at least annually to reflect changes in the business environment.
4. Improving documentation standards to ensure clear and unambiguous language.
5. Establishing a clear governance structure for BCDR, including roles and responsibilities.

By addressing these gaps, the organization can improve its resilience and better prepare for potential disruptions."

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as testing gap and suggest adding comprehensive testing requirements.","**Compliance Review Findings:**

The review of the current compliance program reveals a need for improvement in regular testing of controls and procedures. The existing requirements are incomplete, and the current processes lack transparency and accountability. To ensure effective compliance, the following requirements must be met:

* **Test Types:** The current requirements specify only ad-hoc testing, which is insufficient for maintaining a robust compliance program. Additional test types, such as annual or quarterly testing, should be implemented to ensure regular evaluation of controls and procedures.
* **Frequency Requirements:** The current frequency of testing is inadequate, with no clear schedule or deadlines. To maintain compliance, testing should be conducted at least annually, with more frequent testing (e.g., quarterly) for high-risk areas.
* **Documentation Standards:** The current documentation standards are incomplete, and there is no clear guidance on record-keeping and retention. A comprehensive documentation policy should be developed, outlining the types of documents to be maintained, retention periods, and access controls.
* **Result Reporting:** The current reporting requirements are insufficient, with no clear framework for analyzing and reporting test results. A reporting template should be developed, outlining key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for evaluating test effectiveness.
* **Improvement Procedures:** The current procedures for addressing testing gaps and implementing improvements are unclear. A comprehensive improvement plan should be developed, outlining steps for addressing testing gaps, implementing corrective actions, and tracking progress.

**Testing Gap:** The current compliance program lacks comprehensive testing requirements, which poses a significant risk to the organization's overall compliance posture. It is essential to address this gap by developing a robust testing program that includes regular testing, thorough documentation, and effective reporting and improvement procedures.

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive testing requirements to the compliance program, including:

1. Annual or quarterly testing of controls and procedures.
2. Development of a comprehensive documentation policy, outlining record-keeping and retention requirements.
3. Creation of a reporting template, outlining KPIs and metrics for evaluating test effectiveness.
4. Establishment of a clear improvement plan, outlining steps for addressing testing gaps and implementing corrective actions.

By implementing these changes, the organization can ensure a robust compliance program that maintains the integrity of its controls and procedures."
