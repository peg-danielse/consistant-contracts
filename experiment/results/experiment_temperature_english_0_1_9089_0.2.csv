"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I found that there is no explicit mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. However, I did find some clauses that may be relevant to the substitutability of the provider.

Section 5.2 of the contract states that ""Atlassian may audit Customer’s use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer’s Scope of Use."" This clause implies that Atlassian has the right to monitor and assess Customer's use of the Software Products, which could potentially be used to evaluate the substitutability of the provider.

Additionally, Section 10.1(d) of the contract states that ""Customer may increase its Scope of Use by placing a new Order or modifying (by mutual agreement with Atlassian) an existing Order."" This clause suggests that Customer has the flexibility to adjust its Scope of Use, which could be seen as a factor in determining the substitutability of the provider.

However, these clauses do not explicitly address the substitutability of the provider, and there is no clear definition of what constitutes substitutability in the contract.

**Gap:** The contract does not include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider, which is a critical aspect of ensuring business continuity and flexibility in the event of a change in provider.

**Recommendation:** The contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider, including criteria for determining substitutability. This could include factors such as:

* The ease of switching to a new provider
* The level of dependence on the provider's specific services or technology
* The potential impact on business operations in the event of a change in provider
* The availability of alternative providers or solutions

By including such provisions, the contract can ensure that the provider is easily substitutable and that Customer has the flexibility to adapt to changing business needs."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. While the contract mentions the need for Customer to ensure that the Products meet its requirements and regulatory obligations (Section 6.2), it does not provide clear guidelines for assessing substitutability.

To address this gap, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

1. Cost: Establish a clear methodology for evaluating the cost of substituting one Product for another, including any associated costs for training, implementation, and ongoing support.
2. Technical specifications: Define the technical requirements for substitutability, including compatibility with existing systems, data formats, and interfaces.
3. Ease of transition: Develop a framework for assessing the ease of transitioning from one Product to another, including factors such as data migration, user adoption, and system integration.
4. Functional equivalence: Establish a set of functional requirements that must be met by any substitute Product, ensuring that the new Product provides equivalent functionality to the original Product.
5. Performance metrics: Define key performance metrics that will be used to evaluate the substitutability of a new Product, such as uptime, response time, and error rates.

By incorporating these criteria, Atlassian can provide a more comprehensive framework for assessing substitutability and ensure that customers have a clear understanding of the requirements for substituting one Product for another.

Example of revised language:

""Substitutability Assessment: To ensure a seamless transition, Customer must assess the substitutability of any new Product based on the following criteria:

* Cost: The cost of substituting the new Product must be comparable to the original Product, including any associated costs for training, implementation, and ongoing support.
* Technical specifications: The new Product must meet the technical requirements for substitutability, including compatibility with existing systems, data formats, and interfaces.
* Ease of transition: The transition from the original Product to the new Product must be straightforward, with minimal disruption to Customer's operations.
* Functional equivalence: The new Product must provide equivalent functionality to the original Product, including all features and capabilities.
* Performance metrics: The new Product must meet or exceed the performance metrics of the original Product, including uptime, response time, and error rates.

By following this framework, Customer can ensure a successful transition to a new Product and minimize any potential disruptions to its operations."""
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","After reviewing the contract, I found that there is no explicit requirement to document alternative providers in the market. However, there are some clauses that mention the need to comply with certain regulations and laws, which may indirectly imply the need to maintain a list of alternative providers.

Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This clause may require the parties to maintain a list of alternative providers that comply with relevant laws and regulations.

Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) mentions that ""The Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions."" This clause may require the parties to maintain a list of alternative providers that comply with export and import regulations.

However, there is no explicit requirement to maintain a list of alternative providers in the contract. To address this gap, I recommend including a clause that mandates regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This clause could be added to Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) or Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions).

Here is a suggested clause:

""20.14 Market Scan Requirements: Customer must conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers that meet the requirements of this Agreement and relevant laws and regulations. The list of alternative providers must be maintained and updated regularly, and made available to Atlassian upon request.""

This clause would require Customer to maintain a list of alternative providers and update it regularly, which would help ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I confirm that there are no provisions explicitly requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. However, Section 20.15 ""No Contingencies"" states that ""The Products, Support and Advisory Services in each Order are purchased separately and not contingent on purchase or use of other Atlassian products and services, even if listed in the same Order.""

This provision implies that customers have flexibility in choosing Atlassian's products and services, but it does not explicitly require a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. To maintain strategic flexibility, I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to ensure that customers can make informed decisions about their technology investments.

A cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers would consider financial, operational, and strategic factors, such as:

* Financial factors: Total cost of ownership, return on investment, and cost savings
* Operational factors: Integration with existing systems, scalability, and reliability
* Strategic factors: Alignment with business goals, innovation, and risk management

By incorporating regular cost-benefit analyses, customers can ensure that their technology investments remain aligned with their business objectives and that they are making the most informed decisions about their technology spend."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clause that addresses the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives:

**Section 6.2: Product Assessment**

""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use.""

While this clause does not explicitly mention periodic market research, it implies that Customer should regularly assess the Products to ensure they meet their needs and comply with relevant regulations. This assessment may involve evaluating market alternatives.

However, I did not find any specific provisions that require Customer to conduct periodic market research or reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.

**Validation:**

To validate this finding, I considered the following:

1. The clause in Section 6.2 focuses on Customer's responsibility to assess the Products, but it does not explicitly require periodic market research.
2. The Agreement does not contain any provisions that explicitly mandate Customer to conduct market research or reviews.
3. The absence of specific provisions on periodic market research may indicate that Atlassian does not require Customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives through regular reviews.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. This could be achieved by inserting a new clause, such as:

**Section 6.3: Market Review**

""Customer agrees to conduct periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives and assess whether the Products continue to meet their requirements and comply with relevant regulations. Customer will provide Atlassian with written notice of any significant changes in the market or Customer's requirements, and Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to address any concerns or issues raised by Customer.""

This revised clause would require Customer to conduct regular market reviews and provide Atlassian with written notice of any significant changes in the market or Customer's requirements."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there are no explicit requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. However, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not ""rent, lease, sell, distribute or sublicense the Products or (except for Affiliates) include them in a service bureau or outsourcing offering."" This suggests that Customer should have a clear understanding of its existing arrangements with Atlassian to ensure compliance with this provision.

Furthermore, Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. This implies that Atlassian may request information about Customer's existing arrangements with the provider, but it does not explicitly require an assessment of such arrangements.

To address this gap, I recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider. This would ensure that Customer has a clear understanding of its obligations and can take steps to ensure compliance with the contract. Specifically, the review should include:

* Number of existing arrangements with the provider
* Type of arrangements (e.g., software licenses, support agreements, etc.)
* Scope of each arrangement (e.g., specific products, services, or features)

By including these requirements, Customer can ensure that it is meeting its obligations under the contract and can take steps to mitigate any potential risks or non-compliance issues."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that requires the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Section 7.2, ""Third-Party Products,"" states that ""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace ('Third-Party Products').""

However, I have not found any specific provisions that require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. The contract does mention that Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products, but it does not explicitly require Customer to evaluate risks from connected providers.

To address this, I suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers in the contract. This could be achieved by adding a clause that requires Customer to:

* Identify and document all third-party providers used in conjunction with the Products
* Assess the risks associated with each third-party provider, including their security, data protection, and compliance practices
* Evaluate the potential impact of any third-party provider's failure or breach on the Products and Customer's business
* Develop a plan to mitigate any identified risks, including implementing additional security measures or requiring third-party providers to adhere to specific standards

By including these requirements, the contract can ensure that Customer takes a proactive approach to managing risks associated with closely connected providers, and that Atlassian is not held liable for any issues arising from these relationships."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses that relate to the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Specifically, Section 20.13 ""Export Restrictions"" mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, which implies that the customer must comply with all applicable export and import laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products.

However, I did not find any explicit clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services or require tracking dependency on the provider. The contract does not explicitly address concentration risks or provide guidance on how to mitigate them.

To address this gap, I recommend adding a section to the contract that requires the customer to analyze and address concentration risks. This section could be titled ""Concentration Risk Management"" and could include the following requirements:

* The customer must identify and assess the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services.
* The customer must develop a plan to mitigate concentration risks, including identifying alternative providers and implementing contingency plans.
* The customer must regularly review and update its concentration risk assessment and mitigation plan to ensure that it remains effective.

By adding this section, the contract would provide a clear framework for the customer to manage concentration risks and ensure that it is not overly reliant on a single provider for multiple services."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that assesses interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider.

**Clause 7.2: Third-Party Products**

""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.""

This clause acknowledges that the use of Third-Party Products with Atlassian's Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider. However, it does not explicitly assess the interdependencies between these services or how they might amplify operational risks.

**Recommendation**

To address this gap, I suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This could be achieved by adding a clause that requires Atlassian to conduct a risk assessment of the interdependencies between its services and those of third-party providers. This assessment would help identify potential risks and ensure that Atlassian takes steps to mitigate them.

**Example Clause**

""7.2.1 Interdependency Risk Assessment

Atlassian will conduct a risk assessment of the interdependencies between its services and those of third-party providers, including Third-Party Products. This assessment will identify potential risks and ensure that Atlassian takes steps to mitigate them. The assessment will be conducted at least annually and will be made available to Customer upon request.""

By including this clause, Atlassian would be required to proactively assess the interdependencies between its services and those of third-party providers, thereby reducing the risk of operational disruptions and ensuring a more secure and reliable experience for its customers."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a clause that addresses the provider's market share and concentration risk.

**Clause:** Section 20.13 ""Export Restrictions"" mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. However, this clause does not directly address the provider's market share and concentration risk.

**Gap:** There is no explicit clause that evaluates the provider's market share and concentration risk, which could lead to monopoly risks or limited alternatives for the customer.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend adding terms to the agreement that require Atlassian to disclose its market share and concentration risk, and to provide a plan for mitigating potential risks associated with its dominance in the market. This could include:

* Requiring Atlassian to provide an annual report on its market share and concentration risk
* Requiring Atlassian to implement measures to mitigate potential risks associated with its dominance, such as providing alternative products or services
* Requiring Atlassian to provide a plan for ensuring customer resilience in the event of a disruption or failure of its services

By adding these terms, the agreement can better address the potential risks associated with Atlassian's market dominance and provide a more comprehensive framework for evaluating the provider's concentration risk."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","Upon reviewing the contract, I confirm that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. The contract does not address location-specific factors such as infrastructure reliability or natural disasters that could impact the provider's ability to deliver services.

However, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) of the contract does specify that the agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland for customers domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of the State of California for customers elsewhere. This provision may imply a certain level of risk associated with the provider's operations in specific jurisdictions, but it does not explicitly address geographical concentration risks.

To mitigate potential risks, I recommend that the contract be amended to include a geographical risk assessment. This assessment should consider factors such as:

* Infrastructure reliability and availability in the provider's data centers and other critical facilities
* Natural disaster risks, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods, that could impact the provider's operations
* Regulatory risks associated with specific jurisdictions, such as data protection laws or trade restrictions
* Supply chain risks, such as reliance on third-party vendors or suppliers

By including a geographical risk assessment in the contract, the provider can demonstrate its commitment to managing risks and ensuring business continuity, and customers can make more informed decisions about their reliance on the provider's services."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","**Compliance Requirement: EU Data Protection Rules**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses that require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Extracted Provisions:**

1. **Section 4.2 (Security Program)**: Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This provision ensures that Atlassian's security program meets EU data protection standards.
2. **Section 4.2 (Security Program)**: Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures. This provision demonstrates Atlassian's commitment to EU data protection regulations.
3. **Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension)**: Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data if it becomes aware that the data may violate EU data protection laws or the rights of others. This provision highlights Atlassian's responsibility to comply with EU data protection regulations.
4. **Section 6.3 (Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA)**: Customer must not upload to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to process) any patient, medical, or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This provision ensures that Customer complies with EU data protection regulations when handling sensitive health information.
5. **Section 16 (Confidentiality)**: Atlassian must hold Customer's Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement. This provision ensures that Atlassian complies with EU data protection regulations when handling Customer's confidential information.

**Validation:**

These provisions demonstrate that Atlassian has taken steps to comply with EU data protection regulations, specifically the GDPR. However, it is essential to note that these provisions may not be sufficient to ensure full compliance with EU data protection laws.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure full compliance with EU data protection regulations, I recommend that Atlassian include a clause that explicitly requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, such as:

""Third-country providers must comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any other applicable EU data protection laws and regulations when processing Customer Data.""

This clause would provide clarity and ensure that third-country providers understand their obligations under EU data protection regulations."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several clauses that assess the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, particularly in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.

The agreement explicitly states that the laws of the Republic of Ireland will govern the agreement if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and the laws of the State of California will govern if the customer is domiciled elsewhere (Section 20.4). This provision demonstrates Atlassian's consideration of the varying legal frameworks across different jurisdictions and its commitment to ensuring compliance with applicable laws.

Furthermore, the agreement includes a clause on export restrictions, which requires customers to comply with all applicable export and import laws in their access to, use of, and download of the products or any content or records entered into the products (Section 20.13). This provision highlights Atlassian's awareness of the importance of regulatory compliance in international transactions.

Additionally, the agreement includes a clause on government end-users, which specifies that the agreement is subject to, and varied by, the Government Amendment available at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/government-amendment (Section 20.14). This provision demonstrates Atlassian's consideration of the unique regulatory requirements for government customers.

However, I recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider's country to further strengthen the agreement. This could include:

* A clause requiring Atlassian to conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential legal risks in its jurisdiction and to implement measures to mitigate those risks.
* A provision outlining the procedures for handling legal disputes and ensuring that customers are aware of their rights and obligations in the event of a dispute.
* A clause requiring Atlassian to maintain records of its compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including documentation of its risk assessments and mitigation measures.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can further demonstrate its commitment to ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance, and provide customers with greater confidence in its ability to navigate complex legal landscapes."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions:

**Clause 4.2: Security Program**

Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures. Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.

**Clause 4.1: Customer Data**

Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.

**Clause 4.5: Removals and Suspension**

Atlassian has no obligation to monitor Customer Data. Nonetheless, if Atlassian becomes aware that: (a) Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others (including relating to a takedown request received following the guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations), or (b) Customer’s use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may: (i) limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or (ii) suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the relevant Cloud Products.

**Clause 13: Ownership**

Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, neither party grants the other any rights or licenses to its intellectual property under this Agreement. As between the parties, Customer owns all intellectual property and other rights in Customer Data and Customer Materials provided to Atlassian or used with the Products. Atlassian and its licensors retain all intellectual property and other rights in the Products, any Support and Advisory Services deliverables and related source code, Atlassian technology, templates, formats, and dashboards, including any modifications or improvements.

**Clause 16: Confidentiality**

Unless expressly permitted by the disclosing party in writing, the receiving party must: (a) hold the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, and (b) only use such Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement.

**Clause 20.13: Export Restrictions**

The Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. Customer must comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products.

Based on these clauses, it appears that Atlassian has implemented measures to protect Customer Data and comply with data localization requirements. However, to ensure alignment with regulatory and operational needs, I recommend adding data localization provisions to the agreement, specifically:

* Clarifying the location of data processing and storage for Cloud Products
* Specifying the jurisdictions where Customer Data will be processed and stored
* Outlining the procedures for data transfer and storage in third-country jurisdictions
* Ensuring compliance with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA

These provisions will help mitigate associated risks and ensure that Atlassian's data localization practices align with regulatory and operational requirements."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified that there are no provisions assessing country-specific operational risks. This is a significant gap in the contract, as it does not account for potential risks associated with operating in various countries with different regulatory environments, political stability, and infrastructure capabilities.

The absence of such provisions may expose Atlassian to unforeseen risks, such as:

* Compliance issues due to unfamiliarity with local laws and regulations
* Delays or disruptions in service delivery caused by infrastructure limitations
* Reputation damage resulting from involvement in politically sensitive or unstable regions
* Increased costs associated with navigating complex regulatory environments

To address this gap, I recommend adding a provision that requires Atlassian to conduct a country-specific risk assessment for each country where the Products will be used or accessed. This assessment should consider factors such as:

* Political stability and potential for unrest
* Regulatory environment and compliance requirements
* Infrastructure capabilities and potential for disruptions
* Local laws and regulations related to data protection, intellectual property, and other relevant areas

By incorporating such a provision, Atlassian can better mitigate country-specific operational risks and ensure a more stable and secure service delivery."

Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.","**Compliance Statement:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly mandate regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider on a defined schedule.

Upon reviewing the contract, I found that Section 5.2, ""License Verification,"" mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. However, this provision does not specifically address critical risk assessments.

Additionally, Section 20.11, ""Subcontractors and Affiliates,"" states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. This provision does not explicitly require regular risk assessments.

**Recommendation:** To maintain operational resilience, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments of the ICT third-party provider. This clause could be included in the contract as follows:

""20.12. Critical Risk Assessments: Atlassian shall conduct regular critical risk assessments of its ICT third-party providers at least annually, or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties. These assessments shall be conducted in accordance with industry-recognized standards and shall identify and mitigate any critical risks associated with the ICT third-party providers. Atlassian shall provide Customer with a summary of the critical risk assessments and any resulting mitigation measures.""

This clause would ensure that Atlassian regularly evaluates and addresses critical risks associated with its ICT third-party providers, maintaining operational resilience and compliance with industry standards."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified that the contract does not explicitly specify risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments.

To address this gap, I suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. For example, the contract could include provisions for:

* Contingency plans for critical risks, such as data breaches or system failures
* Redundancies for critical systems or processes
* Alternative providers for critical services or products
* Regular risk assessments and updates to the contract to reflect changing risk landscapes

By incorporating these provisions, the contract can better address critical risks and provide a more comprehensive framework for risk mitigation. This would enhance the overall compliance and risk management posture of the agreement."

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance with this requirement, it is recommended that the contract be modified to include provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics (e.g., service availability, response times). This will enable Atlassian to proactively identify and mitigate potential risks related to its performance and operations.

**Specific Recommendations:**

1. Specify monitoring tools: Identify specific tools or software that Atlassian will use to monitor its performance and operations, such as service level monitoring tools or security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
2. Define monitoring frequency: Determine the frequency at which Atlassian will conduct monitoring activities, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
3. Establish reporting requirements: Specify the types of reports that Atlassian will provide to Customer regarding its monitoring activities, such as incident reports or security breach notifications.
4. Define metrics for evaluation: Identify specific metrics that will be used to evaluate Atlassian's performance and operations, such as service availability, response times, or security incident rates.

By incorporating these provisions into the contract, Customer can ensure that Atlassian is taking proactive steps to monitor and mitigate potential risks related to its performance and operations."

While these clauses do mention audits and force majeure events, they do not explicitly require regular reassessments of risks triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals. To address this gap, I recommend adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments to the agreement.

**Suggested Addition:**

Consider adding a clause that requires Atlassian to conduct regular risk reassessments, such as:

* Section [insert new section]: Risk Reassessments - Atlassian shall conduct regular risk reassessments, at least annually, to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with its operations, market conditions, or technological advancements. These reassessments shall be triggered by significant changes, such as changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards, and shall be documented in writing.

This addition will ensure that Atlassian remains vigilant in identifying and mitigating potential risks, and that the customer is protected from unforeseen consequences."

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is evident that the contract does not explicitly address the assessment of technological lock-in risks. This is a critical compliance concern, as vendor lock-in can significantly impact a customer's ability to switch providers, potentially leading to financial and operational burdens.

**Relevant Clauses:**

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not ""reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Products."" While this clause aims to protect Atlassian's intellectual property, it may inadvertently contribute to vendor lock-in by limiting Customer's ability to understand and potentially switch to alternative technologies.
* Section 5.1 (Modifications) allows Atlassian to provide source code for Customer to use internally, but requires Customer to keep the source code secure and confidential. This clause may create a dependency on Atlassian's proprietary technologies, making it more difficult for Customer to switch providers.
* Section 10.1 (Fees) states that fees are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in the Agreement. This clause may create a financial burden for Customer if they need to switch providers, as they may be required to pay for unused or unexpired services.

**Recommendations:**

To address the risks of vendor lock-in, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating these risks and specifying potential exit strategies. This can be achieved by:

* Adding a clause that requires Atlassian to provide a clear and transparent assessment of the risks associated with vendor lock-in, including the potential costs and consequences of switching providers.
* Specifying potential exit strategies, such as providing access to source code, data migration tools, or other resources to facilitate a smooth transition to alternative technologies.
* Requiring Atlassian to provide a reasonable notice period for any changes to the Agreement or the Products that may impact Customer's ability to switch providers.
* Including a clause that allows Customer to terminate the Agreement without penalty if Atlassian fails to provide a reasonable exit strategy or if the risks of vendor lock-in become unacceptable.

By addressing these concerns, the Atlassian Customer Agreement can better protect Customer's interests and provide a more transparent and compliant contract."

Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies.","**Compliance Assessment: Proprietary Technology Dependencies**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is evident that proprietary technology dependencies are assessed through various clauses. Specifically, Section 5.1 (Modifications) highlights the use of source code for creating bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications of the Software Products. Additionally, Section 13 (Ownership) emphasizes the ownership of intellectual property and other rights in the Products, including any modifications or improvements.

However, upon further examination, it appears that these dependencies are not explicitly documented or monitored. For instance, Section 5.2 (License Verification) only requires Customer to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use upon Atlassian's written request, but does not specify any procedures for documenting or monitoring proprietary technology dependencies.

**Recommendation**

To address this compliance gap, I suggest adding provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies. This could include:

1. Requiring Customer to provide a detailed inventory of proprietary technologies used in conjunction with the Products.
2. Establishing a process for Atlassian to review and approve any custom software, unique configurations, or exclusive systems used with the Products.
3. Developing a system for monitoring and tracking proprietary technology dependencies, including any updates or changes to these dependencies.
4. Incorporating these provisions into the Agreement, specifically in Section 5 (Software Products) and Section 13 (Ownership).

By implementing these measures, Atlassian can better manage and mitigate risks associated with proprietary technology dependencies, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and protecting its intellectual property."

To address this compliance gap, I recommend including clauses that require Atlassian to periodically evaluate how technological changes might impact the substitutability of services or systems and operational continuity. This could be achieved by adding a new section to the agreement, such as Section 4.3 (Technological Change Assessment), which would require Atlassian to:

* Conduct regular assessments of technological changes and their potential impact on substitutability and operational continuity
* Identify and mitigate risks associated with technological changes
* Provide notice to customers of any significant changes that may impact substitutability or operational continuity
* Develop and implement plans to ensure continuity of services in the event of technological changes

**Clause 5.2 (License Verification)**: This clause allows Atlassian to audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. This may indicate a risk of resource concentration if Customer relies heavily on Atlassian's licensing and support.

**Clause 10.1 (Fees)**: This clause requires Customer to pay fees for the Products, Support, and Advisory Services, which may indicate a risk of resource concentration if Customer relies heavily on Atlassian's services and does not have alternative providers.

**Clause 20.13 (Export Restrictions)**: This clause requires Customer to comply with export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, which may indicate a risk of resource concentration if Customer relies heavily on international trade and does not have alternative suppliers.

To address these risks, I recommend adding requirements to evaluate and address resource concentration risks, such as:

* Conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential resource concentration risks
* Developing strategies to mitigate these risks, such as diversifying suppliers, developing in-house expertise, or implementing backup systems
* Establishing clear policies and procedures for managing resource concentration risks

Upon reviewing the contract, I have identified the following terms related to incident management and escalation procedures:

* **Section 8: Support and Advisory Services** states that Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies. This includes the provision of incident management and escalation procedures.
* **Section 11: Atlassian Warranties** mentions that Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to correct non-conformities in the Products, and if such remedy is impracticable, either party may terminate the affected Subscription Term.
* **Section 12: Term and Termination** outlines the procedures for termination of the Agreement, including notice periods and refund policies.
* **Section 20: General Terms** includes a provision for compliance with Laws, which implies that the parties must comply with relevant regulations and standards for incident management and escalation.

However, upon closer examination, I have found that the contract does not explicitly include an escalation matrix with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines for each escalation stage. To address this, I suggest adding the following terms to the contract:

**Escalation Matrix:**

* **Level 1:** Initial Response (24/7)
	+ Response Time: 1 hour
	+ Response Team: Support Team
	+ Responsibilities: Acknowledge receipt of incident, provide initial assessment and resolution
* **Level 2:** Incident Management (Business Hours)
	+ Response Time: 2 hours
	+ Response Team: Incident Management Team
	+ Responsibilities: Investigate and resolve incident, provide updates to customer
* **Level 3:** Escalation to Higher Management (Business Hours)

	+ Responsibilities: Respond to critical incident, provide updates to customer and stakeholders

**Communication Protocols:**

* All communication related to incident management and escalation will be conducted via email, phone, or ticketing system.
* The customer will be notified of any changes to the escalation matrix or communication protocols.

By including these terms, the contract will provide a clear and structured approach to incident management and escalation, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly and effectively."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including terms requiring a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to incident management and root cause analysis:

**Incident Management and Root Cause Analysis**

Section 4.5 of the Agreement states that if Atlassian becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others, or if Customer's use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products. However, this section does not explicitly mention root cause analysis.

**Recommendation**

To enhance transparency and accountability, I recommend including terms requiring a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents. This would ensure that Atlassian conducts a thorough investigation to identify the underlying causes of any incidents, and shares the findings with the financial entity in a timely manner.

**Timeline for Root Cause Analysis**

Unfortunately, the Agreement does not specify a timeline for completing the root cause analysis or sharing the findings with the financial entity. To address this, I suggest adding a clause that outlines the following:

* A specific timeline for completing the root cause analysis (e.g., within 30 days of the incident)
* A requirement for Atlassian to share the findings with the financial entity within a specified timeframe (e.g., within 60 days of the incident)
* A provision for regular updates on the progress of the root cause analysis and any subsequent actions taken by Atlassian to prevent similar incidents in the future.

By including these terms, the Agreement would provide a clear framework for incident management and root cause analysis, ensuring transparency and accountability for both parties."

Specifically, Section 11.2 (Performance Warranty Remedy) outlines the process for addressing a breach of a Performance Warranty. If Atlassian breaches a Performance Warranty, it will use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity. If Atlassian determines that such remedy is impracticable, either party may terminate the affected Subscription Term, and Atlassian will refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.

However, I did not find any specific provisions that mandate a timeline or scope for corrective measures. While Section 11.2 mentions that Atlassian will use ""reasonable efforts"" to correct the non-conformity, it does not provide a specific timeframe or scope for these efforts.

To address this gap, I suggest including a clause that mandates timely implementation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents. This could be achieved by adding a provision similar to the following:

""Upon identifying a root cause of an incident, Atlassian shall implement corrective actions within a reasonable timeframe, as determined by Atlassian, to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. The corrective actions shall be documented and communicated to Customer, and shall include a plan for implementation, timeline, and scope. Customer shall be notified of any changes to the plan or timeline, and shall have the opportunity to provide feedback and input on the corrective actions.""

This proposed clause would ensure that Atlassian takes timely and effective corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents, and provides transparency and accountability in the process."

3. **Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination)**: Upon termination, Atlassian will delete customer data in accordance with the documentation, which is crucial for maintaining operational resilience and compliance with DORA.

**Operational Resilience Measures:**

1. **Section 4.2 (Security Program)**: Atlassian's security program includes measures to protect against cyber-attacks, data breaches, and other disruptions that could impact operational resilience.
2. **Section 5.1 (Modifications)**: Customers are responsible for ensuring that modifications to the software products do not compromise operational resilience.
3. **Section 10.3 (Return Policy)**: Customers can terminate their subscription and receive a refund within 30 days, which allows for flexibility in case of operational disruptions.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Add a compliance clause:** Include a specific clause that requires customers to maintain BCDR plans that comply with DORA regulations, ensuring operational resilience for critical functions.
2. **Define critical functions:** Identify and define critical functions that require operational resilience measures, such as customer data protection, software availability, and incident response.

**RTOs:**

* Section 4.5: ""Removals and Suspension"" states that Atlassian may limit access to or remove Customer Data if it becomes aware of a potential security threat or unauthorized access. However, this clause does not specify a clear RTO for restoring access to critical services.
* Section 9: ""Ordering Process and Delivery"" mentions that Atlassian will deliver login instructions or license keys for Products electronically, but it does not specify a RTO for delivery.

**RPOs:**

* Section 4.1: ""Customer Data"" mentions that Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services. However, this clause does not specify a clear RPO for data backup and recovery.

**Measurability:**

* The identified clauses do not clearly specify measurable RTOs and RPOs for critical services. For example, it is unclear what constitutes a ""reasonable"" time for restoring access to critical services or what data loss is acceptable.

**Recommendations:**

* To ensure clarity and measurability, I suggest adding specific RTOs and RPOs for critical services in the contract. For example:
	+ RTO for restoring access to critical services: 2 hours
	+ RPO for data backup and recovery: 24 hours
	+ RTO for delivery of login instructions or license keys: 1 hour

* Section 4.2 (Security Program) requires Atlassian to maintain an information security program that includes measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
* Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) states that upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation.

However, I did not find any specific requirements for periodic updates to BCDR plans. To ensure compliance with the agreement, I recommend adding periodic updates to BCDR plans as follows:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) should be updated to include a requirement for Customer to review and update its BCDR plan periodically (e.g., every 6-12 months) to ensure compliance with the agreement.
* Section 4.2 (Security Program) should be updated to include a requirement for Atlassian to provide regular security updates and patches to the Products to ensure the security and integrity of Customer Data.
* Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) should be updated to include a requirement for Atlassian to provide Customer with a copy of its BCDR plan and any relevant documentation upon termination of the agreement.

By adding these requirements, Atlassian can ensure that Customer's BCDR plans are up-to-date and compliant with the agreement, and that Customer Data is protected in the event of a disaster or operational change."

* Section 15.1: IP Indemnification - Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. However, there is no specific timeline for reporting such incidents.

Regulatory standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), require incident reporting timelines to be defined and communicated to customers. The GDPR, for example, requires organizations to notify affected individuals and the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach.

In this case, the Atlassian Customer Agreement does not specify a timeline for incident reporting. This gap may not align with regulatory standards, and customers may not be aware of the incident reporting process or timelines.

**Recommendation:**

To align with regulatory standards, I recommend that Atlassian includes specific incident reporting timelines in the Customer Agreement, such as:

* A timeline for reporting security or operational issues that may impact customer data or systems
* A timeline for notifying customers of potential security or operational issues
* A timeline for responding to and resolving incidents

By defining incident reporting timelines, Atlassian can ensure compliance with regulatory standards and maintain transparency with customers."

**Validation:**

The clause allows Atlassian to subcontract services, but it does not specify any limitations on the types of subcontracted services, geographical locations, or critical functions. This raises concerns about the potential risks associated with subcontracting, particularly for critical or important functions.

**Recommendation:**

To address these concerns, I recommend including additional terms that define clear boundaries for subcontracting, particularly for critical or important functions. This could include:

* Limitations on the types of subcontracted services, such as excluding critical functions or sensitive data processing
* Geographical restrictions on subcontracting, such as limiting subcontractors to specific regions or countries
* Requirements for subcontractors to meet specific security or quality standards
* Provisions for Atlassian to maintain control over subcontracted services and ensure compliance with the Agreement

**Flagged Absence:**

The absence of these restrictions and conditions in the current contract highlights the need for additional terms to ensure that subcontracting is managed effectively and that critical functions are not compromised.

**Recommended Terms:**

To address these concerns, I recommend including the following terms:

* ""Atlassian shall not subcontract any critical functions or services that require access to sensitive data or confidential information without prior written consent from Customer.""
* ""Atlassian shall ensure that all subcontractors meet the same security and quality standards as Atlassian, and shall maintain control over subcontracted services to ensure compliance with this Agreement.""

**Gap Analysis:** While the contract mentions the need for written agreements with subcontractors, it does not specify the approval process, criteria, or timelines for obtaining prior written approval from the financial entity. This gap creates uncertainty and potential risks for the financial entity.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I suggest adding a clause that mandates prior approval from the financial entity before the provider engages subcontractors. The clause should specify the approval process, criteria, and timelines, and clearly state that subcontracting without consent constitutes a breach of the contract.

**Proposed Clause:**

""20.11.1 Prior Approval for Subcontracting: Atlassian must obtain prior written approval from [Financial Entity] before engaging any subcontractor to perform any obligations under this Agreement. The approval process will be as follows:

Regarding changes to the subcontracting structure, Section 20.11 does not explicitly require Atlassian to notify the customer of any changes to its subcontracting structure. This lack of transparency may make it difficult for the customer to track and verify the subcontracting chain.

Regarding the financial entity's right to access this information, Section 20.11 does not explicitly grant the customer the right to access information about Atlassian's subcontractors or subcontracting structure.

In light of these findings, I suggest adding the following clauses to the contract to ensure transparency in subcontracting chains:

* Clause 1: Atlassian shall disclose to the customer the names and roles of all subcontractors involved in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
* Clause 2: Atlassian shall notify the customer of any changes to its subcontracting structure, including the addition or removal of subcontractors, within [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days].
* Clause 3: The customer shall have the right to access information about Atlassian's subcontractors and subcontracting structure, including documentation of the subcontracting agreements and any changes thereto.

By adding these clauses, the contract will provide greater transparency and accountability in Atlassian's subcontracting chains, enabling the customer to better track and verify the subcontracting chain and ensuring that Atlassian meets its obligations under the Agreement."

Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including clauses for timely notification and risk evaluation of any changes in the subcontracting structure.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following provisions related to changes in the subcontracting chain:

**Notification Requirements for Changes**

Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any notification requirements for changes in the subcontracting chain.

**Re-assessment of Risks for New Subcontractors or Structural Changes**

Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) also states that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any process for re-assessing risks for new subcontractors or structural changes.

**Recommendation**

To ensure compliance with the requirements for changes in the subcontracting chain, I recommend including the following clauses in the contract:

* Timely notification requirements for changes in the subcontracting structure, including notification to the customer and any relevant authorities.
* A process for re-assessing risks for new subcontractors or structural changes, including an evaluation of the subcontractor's qualifications, experience, and performance history.
* A requirement for Atlassian to obtain the customer's consent before making any changes to the subcontracting structure.

These clauses will help ensure that the customer is informed and involved in any changes to the subcontracting structure, and that the risks associated with those changes are properly evaluated and mitigated."
"Search for clauses specifying restrictions or conditions for subcontracting. Extract details about limitations on services, geography, or critical functions.

**20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

This clause does not specify any limitations on services, geography, or critical functions that subcontractors or Affiliates may perform. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain control over critical functions, I recommend adding the following restrictions:

* **Limited Services**: Atlassian shall only subcontract services that are not critical to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, such as non-core administrative tasks.
* **Geographic Restrictions**: Atlassian shall only subcontract services to entities located within the same country or region as the Customer, or to entities that have established a presence in the Customer's country or region.
* **Critical Functions**: Atlassian shall not subcontract any critical functions, such as data processing, security, or customer support, without prior written consent from the Customer.

To incorporate these restrictions, the clause could be revised as follows:

**20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but only for non-critical services, and only within the same country or region as the Customer, or to entities that have established a presence in the Customer's country or region. Atlassian shall not subcontract any critical functions, such as data processing, security, or customer support, without prior written consent from the Customer. Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."

However, this provision does not explicitly require prior approval from the customer for subcontracting. In fact, it only mentions that Atlassian will have ""appropriate written agreements"" with its subcontractors, but it does not specify that the customer needs to approve these agreements.

To address this gap, I recommend including a provision that requires prior approval from the customer for subcontracting. This would ensure that the customer is aware of and agrees to any subcontracting arrangements that may impact the performance of the agreement.

Here is a suggested revised provision:

""20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates. Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, subject to prior written approval from Customer. Prior to engaging any subcontractor or Affiliate, Atlassian shall provide Customer with written notice of the proposed subcontractor or Affiliate, including details of the subcontractor's or Affiliate's role, responsibilities, and any relevant experience or qualifications. Customer shall have the right to approve or reject the proposed subcontractor or Affiliate within [insert timeframe, e.g., 10 business days]. If Customer fails to respond within the specified timeframe, it shall be deemed to have approved the proposed subcontractor or Affiliate. Atlassian shall remain responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for ensuring that its subcontractors and Affiliates comply with the terms of this Agreement.""

This revised provision requires Atlassian to obtain prior written approval from the customer before engaging any subcontractor or Affiliate, and provides a clear process for the customer to approve or reject the proposed subcontractor or Affiliate."
Locate terms requiring monitoring of subcontractors. Validate whether these include audits or compliance checks. Suggest adding monitoring requirements if missing.,"Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following terms requiring monitoring of subcontractors:

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

However, these terms do not explicitly mention audits or compliance checks as part of the monitoring requirements. To ensure compliance with the agreement, I suggest adding the following language to Section 20.11:

""Atlassian will conduct regular audits and compliance checks on its subcontractors to ensure they are meeting the requirements of this Agreement and are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Atlassian will provide Customer with access to the results of these audits and compliance checks upon request.""

This addition will provide clarity on the monitoring requirements and ensure that Atlassian is held accountable for its subcontractors' performance and compliance.

Additionally, it is recommended to specify the frequency and scope of the audits and compliance checks to ensure that they are adequate and effective. For example:

""Atlassian will conduct annual audits and compliance checks on its subcontractors, which will include a review of their compliance with this Agreement, applicable laws and regulations, and industry standards. The audits and compliance checks will be conducted by an independent third-party auditor, and Atlassian will provide Customer with a written report of the results within 30 days of completion.""

By adding these monitoring requirements, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to compliance and ensure that its subcontractors are meeting the necessary standards."

However, there is no explicit provision mandating a risk assessment of subcontractors.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend adding a risk evaluation process for subcontractors. This process should include the following criteria and scope:

1. **Risk Assessment Criteria:** Atlassian should establish a set of criteria to evaluate subcontractors, including:
	* Financial stability and reputation
	* Technical expertise and capabilities
	* Compliance with relevant laws and regulations
	* Data security and confidentiality measures
	* Business continuity and disaster recovery plans
	* Quality control and assurance processes
2. **Risk Evaluation Scope:** The risk evaluation process should cover all subcontractors involved in the performance of Atlassian's obligations under the Agreement, including:
	* Subcontractors providing services related to product development, support, and maintenance
	* Subcontractors handling customer data and sensitive information
	* Subcontractors with access to Atlassian's systems, networks, or confidential information
3. **Risk Assessment Frequency:** Atlassian should conduct regular risk assessments of subcontractors, at least annually, to ensure that their risk profiles remain acceptable.
4. **Risk Mitigation Measures:** Based on the risk assessment results, Atlassian should implement risk mitigation measures, such as:
	* Conducting due diligence on subcontractors
	* Requiring subcontractors to implement additional security measures
	* Establishing clear communication channels and escalation procedures
	* Monitoring subcontractor performance and compliance
5. **Documentation and Record-Keeping:** Atlassian should maintain detailed records of subcontractor risk assessments, including:
	* Risk assessment reports and findings
	* Risk mitigation measures implemented
	* Compliance monitoring and audit results

By implementing a risk evaluation process for subcontractors, Atlassian can ensure that it maintains a robust and secure supply chain, protects customer data, and upholds its compliance obligations."
Identify clauses requiring evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains. Extract references to the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion. Suggest adding this requirement if absent.,"**Compliance Evaluation: Subcontracting Chain Complexity**

This Agreement requires careful evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and mitigate potential risks. Specifically, Clause 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, the clause does not specify any requirements for evaluating the length and complexity of subcontracting chains.

**Extracted References:**

* Clause 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions the use of subcontractors or Affiliates, but does not provide any guidance on evaluating the length and complexity of subcontracting chains.
* There are no references to the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion in the Agreement.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and mitigate potential risks, it is recommended that the Agreement include a requirement for evaluating the length and complexity of subcontracting chains. This can be achieved by adding a clause that specifies the following:

* The maximum number of subcontractors allowed in a subcontracting chain.
* The geographical dispersion of subcontractors, including any restrictions on subcontracting to entities in high-risk countries or regions.
* The procedures for evaluating and approving subcontractors, including any requirements for due diligence and risk assessments.

**Proposed Clause:**

20.11.1 Subcontracting Chain Evaluation

Atlassian shall evaluate and approve all subcontractors in a subcontracting chain to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and mitigate potential risks. The subcontracting chain shall not exceed [insert number] levels of subcontracting, and subcontractors shall be located in [insert geographical region or country]. Atlassian shall conduct due diligence and risk assessments on all subcontractors, including any requirements for:

* Background checks and verification of subcontractor identity.
* Review of subcontractor financial stability and creditworthiness.
* Assessment of subcontractor experience and expertise in performing similar services.
* Evaluation of subcontractor compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.

By adding this clause, Atlassian can ensure that its subcontracting chains are transparent, manageable, and compliant with regulatory requirements, thereby mitigating potential risks and ensuring compliance with this Agreement."
"Search for provisions assessing the provider's ability to monitor subcontracting chains. Extract details of tools or processes mentioned.

Specifically, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

However, I did not find any specific provisions or tools mentioned in the Agreement that assess Atlassian's ability to monitor subcontracting chains. To ensure compliance with this requirement, I recommend including monitoring mechanisms in the Agreement.

Here are some potential tools or processes that could be included:

1. **Regular audits**: Atlassian could commit to regular audits of its subcontracting chains to ensure compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws.
2. **Subcontractor onboarding process**: Atlassian could establish a standardized onboarding process for subcontractors, which includes verifying their compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws.
3. **Monitoring and reporting**: Atlassian could commit to monitoring its subcontracting chains and providing regular reports to Customer on the performance of subcontractors.
4. **Subcontractor certification**: Atlassian could require subcontractors to obtain certifications or comply with industry standards, such as ISO 27001, to ensure they meet certain security and compliance requirements.
5. **Escalation procedures**: Atlassian could establish clear escalation procedures for addressing any issues or concerns related to subcontracting chains.

To incorporate these monitoring mechanisms into the Agreement, I suggest adding the following language:

""Atlassian will maintain a robust monitoring and audit program to ensure compliance with this Agreement and applicable laws in its subcontracting chains. This program will include regular audits, subcontractor onboarding processes, monitoring and reporting, subcontractor certification, and escalation procedures. Atlassian will provide Customer with regular updates on the performance of subcontractors and will address any issues or concerns related to subcontracting chains in a timely manner.""
