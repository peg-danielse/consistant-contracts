"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","**Compliance Observation:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA (DevOps, Reliability, Observability, and Security) compliance. However, there are several clauses that imply the customer's responsibility for compliance, including:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that the customer must not violate any Law, which implies that the customer is responsible for complying with DORA obligations.
* Section 6.2 (Product Assessment) states that the customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use.
* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business, which implies that the customer is responsible for complying with DORA obligations.
* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under the agreement. This implies that the customer's responsibility for DORA compliance cannot be diminished by outsourcing.

However, there is no clear statement that explicitly retains the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance, nor is there a specific reference to DORA obligations. It is recommended that the customer reviews their internal compliance policies and procedures to ensure they are meeting their DORA obligations."

* The contract includes a comprehensive list of financial services laws and regulations that Atlassian is subject to, including the Acceptable Use Policy, Advisory Services Policy, and Security Measures (Section 20.1).

**Recommendation:**

While the contract provides a comprehensive coverage of financial services laws and regulations, it is recommended that an explicit clause be added to cover the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should include language such as:

""Atlassian retains full responsibility for compliance with all applicable financial services laws and regulations, including but not limited to [list specific laws and regulations]. Atlassian acknowledges that it will maintain ongoing regulatory obligations and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including any future updates or amendments.""

This additional clause will provide clarity and ensure that Atlassian's retained responsibility for financial services laws is explicitly stated in the contract."

* The contract does not provide a clear and comprehensive list of all parties' rights, particularly regarding the use of the Products, Support, and Advisory Services.
* The obligations section could be more detailed, including specific requirements for the Customer to fulfill, such as providing timely access to Customer Materials and personnel.
* The liability and indemnification clauses could be more comprehensive, including specific limits on liability and indemnification obligations for both parties.
* The contract does not explicitly state the consequences of a breach of contract, including any penalties or remedies for non-compliance.
* The contract does not provide a clear process for dispute resolution or arbitration in the event of a disagreement between the parties.

To address these gaps, I recommend adding comprehensive rights and obligations documentation to the contract, including:

* A detailed list of all parties' rights and responsibilities, including specific requirements for the Customer to fulfill.
* A clear and comprehensive definition of the scope of service, including the specific services and deliverables to be provided by Atlassian.
* A more detailed liability and indemnification clause, including specific limits on liability and indemnification obligations for both parties.
* A clear process for dispute resolution or arbitration in the event of a disagreement between the parties.
* A section outlining the consequences of a breach of contract, including any penalties or remedies for non-compliance.

By adding these essential contract elements, the parties can ensure a clear understanding of their rights and obligations, reducing the risk of disputes and improving overall compliance with the agreement."

The Atlassian Customer Agreement is a comprehensive contract that outlines the terms and conditions for the use of Atlassian's products and services. Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that the agreement is well-structured and follows a clear organization. However, upon closer examination, some essential elements are missing or not properly organized.

Clear Section Organization: The contract is divided into 21 sections, which cover various aspects of the agreement, including definitions, scope of use, warranties, indemnification, and termination. The sections are logically organized, and each section addresses a specific topic.

Definition of Terms: The contract defines key terms, including ""Customer Data,"" ""Cloud Products,"" and ""Scope of Use,"" which is essential for understanding the agreement.

However, the following essential elements are missing or not properly organized:

* Table of Contents: The contract does not have a table of contents, making it difficult for readers to navigate the document and locate specific sections.
* Cross-Referencing: While the contract has some cross-references, they are not consistently used throughout the document, which can make it challenging to follow the agreement's logic.
* Signature Blocks and Dates: The contract does not have a signature block or a date for acceptance, which is crucial for establishing the effective date of the agreement.

Recommendations for Restructuring the Agreement:

1. Add a Table of Contents: Include a table of contents to facilitate navigation and help readers locate specific sections.
2. Improve Cross-Referencing: Use consistent cross-referencing throughout the contract to ensure that readers can easily follow the agreement's logic.
3. Include Signature Blocks and Dates: Add a signature block and a date for acceptance to establish the effective date of the agreement.
4. Consider Using a More Formal Structure: The contract's current structure is clear, but it may benefit from a more formal structure, such as using separate sections for each product or service.
5. Clarify Ambiguous Language: Some language in the contract is ambiguous or unclear. Consider revising these sections to ensure that they are easily understandable by readers.

By addressing these issues, the Atlassian Customer Agreement can be improved to ensure that all essential elements are properly organized and documented. This will facilitate easier navigation and understanding of the agreement, ultimately reducing the risk of misunderstandings or disputes."

Follow-up if Missing: Flag as audit gap and suggest adding comprehensive process audit rights.","Compliance Review: Audit Rights and Processes

Upon reviewing the provided document, it appears that the audit rights and processes are not clearly defined, creating potential compliance gaps. To address this, a comprehensive audit rights agreement should be added to the contract.

**Audit Scope**: The audit scope should be clearly defined, specifying the areas and systems subject to audit, including access to all relevant documentation and systems. This should be explicitly stated in the contract.

**Methodology Requirements**: The contract should outline the requirements for audit methodologies, including the use of independent auditors, and specify the level of detail required for the audit report.

**Documentation Access**: The contract should provide for access to all relevant documentation, including financial records, business processes, and system logs, to enable a thorough audit.

**Testing Permissions**: The contract should grant the auditors the necessary permissions to conduct testing and verify the accuracy of the information provided.

**Report Requirements**: The contract should specify the requirements for the audit report, including the format, content, and submission deadlines.

To address potential audit gaps, the following should be added to the contract:

* A comprehensive audit rights agreement that outlines the audit scope, methodology requirements, documentation access, testing permissions, and report requirements.
* A clause that requires the auditors to maintain confidentiality and protect sensitive information.
* A clause that specifies the frequency and timing of audits, including any required notice periods.
* A clause that outlines the consequences for non-compliance with audit requirements.

Flagging this as an audit gap, it is recommended that the contract be updated to include comprehensive process audit rights to ensure that all necessary audit requirements are met."

* It does not specify roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and incident management procedures.
* The plan is missing critical components, such as data backup and recovery processes, incident response plans, and business continuity procedures.

**Alignment with Operational Needs:**

* The plan does not take into account the organization's operational needs, such as critical business processes, infrastructure, and technology dependencies.
* It does not consider the impact of disasters on key stakeholders, including employees, customers, and suppliers.

**Update Frequency:**

* The plan has not been updated in the past year, which is inadequate given the dynamic nature of business operations and changing risk landscape.
* The update frequency should be at least annually, with regular reviews and updates to ensure the plan remains relevant and effective.

**Testing Requirements:**

* The plan lacks a comprehensive testing schedule, which is critical for identifying weaknesses and ensuring the plan's effectiveness.
* Regular testing should be conducted at least twice a year, with a thorough review of results and corrective actions taken as needed.
