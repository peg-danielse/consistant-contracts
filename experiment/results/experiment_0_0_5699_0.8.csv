"Search for contractual provisions requiring assessment of ICT-related dependencies. Look specifically for:
 • Methodology for evaluating nature of dependencies
 • Scale assessment requirements
 • Complexity evaluation criteria
 • Importance classification metrics
 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as critical gap and recommend adding structured framework for dependency assessment aligned with DORA requirements.","**Critical Gap Identified:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly outline a structured methodology for evaluating ICT-related dependencies, nor does it provide specific requirements for assessing the scale, complexity, or importance of such dependencies. This absence is critical, as it leaves room for subjective interpretations and potential oversights in dependency management.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I recommend adding a structured framework for dependency assessment aligned with the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) requirements. This framework should include:

1. **Methodology for evaluating nature of dependencies**: Define a clear, step-by-step approach for identifying and categorizing dependencies based on their characteristics, such as technical, operational, or business dependencies.
2. **Scale assessment requirements**: Establish a standardized scale for assessing the scope and magnitude of dependencies, considering factors like number of users, data volumes, or system complexity.
3. **Complexity evaluation criteria**: Develop a set of criteria to evaluate the complexity of dependencies, including factors like technical intricacy, system interactions, or environmental dependencies.
4. **Importance classification metrics**: Introduce a set of metrics to classify the importance of dependencies based on their business impact, risk, or strategic value.

**Example of a Structured Framework:**

To illustrate this recommendation, a sample structured framework for dependency assessment could be:

1. **Dependency Categorization**: Identify dependencies as either:
	* Technical dependencies (e.g., software, hardware, or network dependencies)
	* Operational dependencies (e.g., process, procedure, or personnel dependencies)
	* Business dependencies (e.g., market, customer, or regulatory dependencies)
2. **Scale Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and magnitude of dependencies using a standardized scale (e.g., Low, Medium, High):
	* Low: Limited impact, minimal risk
	* Medium: Moderate impact, moderate risk
	* High: Significant impact, high risk
3. **Complexity Evaluation**: Assess the complexity of dependencies using a set of criteria (e.g., technical intricacy, system interactions, environmental dependencies):
	* Low complexity: Straightforward, well-defined dependencies
	* Medium complexity: Moderate complexity, some interactions or dependencies
	* High complexity: Highly intricate, complex, or critical dependencies
4. **Importance Classification**: Classify the importance of dependencies based on their business impact, risk, or strategic value:
	* Low importance: Minimal impact, low risk
	* Medium importance: Moderate impact, moderate risk
	* High importance: Significant impact, high risk or strategic value

By incorporating this structured framework into the Atlassian Customer Agreement, you can ensure a more comprehensive and objective approach to dependency management, aligning with DORA requirements and promoting better risk management, scalability, and business resilience."

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding detailed system access rights provisions.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following provisions related to audit rights:

**Compliance:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement grants comprehensive audit rights to Atlassian, enabling the company to ensure compliance with its security program and protect customer data.

At Section 2.2 (Restrictions), it is stated that Atlassian reserves the right to monitor Customer's use of the Products and may conduct audits to ensure compliance with the Agreement. Additionally, at Section 5.2 (License Verification), it is specified that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.

**Scope of access:** The Agreement does not explicitly specify the scope of access for Atlassian's audits, which may leave room for interpretation.

**Access conditions:** The Agreement requires that Atlassian give Customer reasonable advance notice of an audit, which is a reasonable condition.

**Notice requirements:** The Agreement requires Atlassian to give Customer notice of an audit, which is a reasonable condition.

**Security protocols:** The Agreement requires that Atlassian implement and maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access (Section 4.2 (Security Program)).

**Documentation requirements:** The Agreement requires Atlassian to maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications (Section 4.2 (Security Program)).

However, the Agreement does not explicitly address the following:

* Specific requirements for Atlassian's audit team, such as qualifications and confidentiality obligations.
* The frequency and duration of audits.
* The types of systems and data that may be subject to audit.
* Any limitations on Atlassian's audit rights, such as restrictions on access to sensitive areas of the system.

**Recommendation:** To provide a comprehensive audit rights framework, I recommend adding detailed system access rights provisions to the Agreement, including:

* A clear description of the scope of access for Atlassian's audits.
* Specific requirements for Atlassian's audit team, such as qualifications and confidentiality obligations.
* The frequency and duration of audits.
* The types of systems and data that may be subject to audit.
* Any limitations on Atlassian's audit rights, such as restrictions on access to sensitive areas of the system.

This would help ensure that both parties understand their obligations and responsibilities regarding audit rights, and provide a clear framework for Atlassian to conduct audits and ensure compliance with its security program."
