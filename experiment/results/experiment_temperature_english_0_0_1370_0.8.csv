"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","After reviewing the provided Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that relate to the financial entity's responsibility for DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) compliance:

**Retained Responsibility**

* Section 2.1 of the Agreement states that ""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer's requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use."" This suggests that the financial entity retains full responsibility for ensuring that the Products meet their regulatory obligations, including DORA compliance.

**References to DORA Obligations**

* There are no explicit references to DORA obligations in the Agreement. However, Section 6.2 mentions ""regulatory obligations related to its intended use,"" which could potentially include DORA requirements.

**Non-Transfer of Compliance Obligations**

* Section 20.3(a) states that ""Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian's prior written consent."" This suggests that the financial entity cannot transfer its compliance obligations to Atlassian, including DORA compliance.

**Acknowledgment that Outsourcing Doesn't Diminish Entity's Responsibility**

* Section 20.11 states that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This implies that even if the financial entity outsources certain functions to Atlassian or its subcontractors, it remains responsible for ensuring DORA compliance.

In summary, while the Agreement does not explicitly mention DORA, the clauses mentioned above suggest that the financial entity retains full responsibility for ensuring DORA compliance and cannot transfer this responsibility to Atlassian."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:
 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","**Compliance Review Findings:**

Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that Atlassian has included various provisions related to financial services laws, but there are some gaps in the language that may need clarification. While the contract does acknowledge Atlassian's responsibility for complying with ""all applicable laws,"" the language is not explicit enough to cover the full scope of financial services regulations.

**Specific Findings:**

1. **Comprehensive coverage:** The contract mentions compliance with ""all applicable laws,"" but does not specifically list the financial services laws that Atlassian is responsible for adhering to. To ensure comprehensive coverage, it is recommended that the contract explicitly reference relevant financial services laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
2. **Non-delegation:** The contract does not explicitly state that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers or subcontractors. To avoid any potential issues, it is recommended that the contract include a non-delegation clause, stating that Atlassian will remain responsible for complying with all applicable financial services laws, regardless of any third-party involvement.
3. **Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations:** The contract does not explicitly acknowledge Atlassian's ongoing regulatory obligations. To ensure that Atlassian remains committed to complying with financial services laws, it is recommended that the contract include a clause stating that Atlassian will continue to comply with all applicable financial services laws throughout the term of the agreement.
4. **References to specific financial services laws:** The contract does not specifically reference any financial services laws, except for the mention of the ""Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)"" in the context of Customer's payment card information. To ensure that Atlassian is held accountable for complying with relevant financial services laws, it is recommended that the contract explicitly reference specific laws, such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and GLBA.

**Recommendation:**

To address these gaps, it is recommended that the contract include an explicit clause covering the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should:

* Clearly acknowledge Atlassian's ongoing regulatory obligations
* Specify that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers or subcontractors
* Reference specific financial services laws, such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and GLBA
* Ensure comprehensive coverage of all applicable financial services regulations

**Proposed Clause:**

""**Retention of Regulatory Responsibilities:** Atlassian acknowledges and agrees that it will retain full responsibility for complying with all applicable financial services laws, including but not limited to:

* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)
* Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
* Any other financial services laws or regulations applicable to the provision of the Products and Services.

Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers or subcontractors and will ensure that all third-party involvement is subject to the same level of regulatory compliance as Atlassian itself.

Atlassian will continue to comply with all applicable financial services laws throughout the term of this agreement and will provide Customer with written notice of any changes to its compliance obligations.""

By incorporating this clause, the contract will ensure that Atlassian retains clear responsibility for complying with all applicable financial services laws, providing a clear and comprehensive framework for regulatory compliance."

However, I have also found some governance gaps that require senior management or board approval.

**Approval Requirements:**

* Section 2.1: ""Subject to this Agreement and during the applicable Subscription Term, Atlassian grants Customer a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Products and related Support and Advisory Services for its and its Affiliates’ internal business purposes...""
* Section 10.1: ""Customer must pay all applicable amounts directly to the Reseller, and Customer’s order details (e.g., Products and Scope of Use) will be specified in the Order placed by the Reseller with Atlassian on Customer’s behalf.""

While these sections do not explicitly mention senior management or board approval, they imply that significant decisions regarding product usage and payment terms are being made by the customer.

**Review Procedures:**

* Section 20.1: ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""
* Section 20.2: ""Atlassian must comply with its Code of Conduct in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

These sections indicate that both parties are responsible for complying with relevant laws and regulations, but they do not specify a review procedure for ensuring compliance.

**Documentation of Approvals:**

* Section 20.5: ""Notices under this Agreement must be in writing and are deemed given on: (i) personal delivery, (ii) when received by the addressee if sent by a recognized overnight courier with receipt request, (iii) the third business day after mailing, or (iv) the first business day after sending by email...""

This section outlines the procedures for providing written notice, but it does not specify the documentation of approvals for significant decisions.

**Renewal Approval Processes:**

* Section 10.1(c): ""Customer may terminate the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term for the affected Products as its exclusive remedy. To exercise this right, Customer must notify Atlassian of its termination under this Section 20.9(c) within thirty (30) days of the modification notice, and Atlassian will refund any pre-paid fees for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.""

This section outlines the process for terminating a subscription, but it does not specify the approval requirements for renewal.

**Governance Gaps:**

Based on the provisions above, I have identified the following governance gaps that require senior management or board approval:

* Explicit approval requirements for significant decisions regarding product usage and payment terms
* Review procedures for ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations
* Documentation of approvals for significant decisions
* Renewal approval processes for subscription terms

**Recommendation:**

To address these governance gaps, I recommend adding explicit board/senior management approval requirements for significant decisions, review procedures for ensuring compliance, documentation of approvals, and renewal approval processes for subscription terms. This will ensure that the organization is properly governing its ICT service agreements and minimizing the risk of non-compliance."

5. Operational Risk: The potential risk of operational disruption or failure.

Classification levels are often used to categorize the criticality of services, processes, or functions into different levels, such as:

1. High: Critical functions that have a significant impact on the organization's business operations, revenue, or reputation.
2. Medium: Functions that have a moderate impact on the organization's business operations, revenue, or reputation.
3. Low: Functions that have a minimal impact on the organization's business operations, revenue, or reputation.

Impact thresholds are used to determine the level of criticality based on the potential impact of a disruption or failure. For example:

1. High Impact: A disruption or failure that would result in a loss of revenue exceeding $1 million or a significant impact on the organization's reputation.
2. Medium Impact: A disruption or failure that would result in a loss of revenue between $100,000 and $1 million or a moderate impact on the organization's reputation.
3. Low Impact: A disruption or failure that would result in a loss of revenue less than $100,000 or a minimal impact on the organization's reputation.

Review requirements typically involve a regular review of the criticality assessment to ensure that it remains accurate and effective. This may involve:

1. Annual reviews of the criticality assessment to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.
2. Regular monitoring of changes to the organization's business operations, regulatory requirements, or customer expectations.
3. Identification of new or emerging risks that may impact the criticality assessment.

In conclusion, a comprehensive criticality assessment framework is essential for ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of an organization's operations. By using a structured approach to assess criticality, organizations can identify areas that require additional resources or attention, and prioritize efforts to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements."

Follow-up if Missing: Flag as continuity gap and suggest adding comprehensive transition planning requirements.","**Compliance Review: Service Continuity during Transition**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement (ACA) emphasizes the importance of service continuity during transitions, ensuring that critical business functions remain operational with minimal disruption. However, a closer examination of the agreement reveals that certain requirements for service continuity during transition are either incomplete or not explicitly addressed. Specifically, the following components of a comprehensive transition plan are missing or unclear:

* **Transition Plan Components**: While the ACA mentions the need for a transition plan, it does not specify the essential components that should be included. A comprehensive transition plan should outline the scope of work, timelines, resource allocation, and key milestones.
* **Timeline Requirements**: The ACA does not provide a clear timeline for the transition process, which can lead to ambiguity and confusion. A well-defined timeline is essential to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the transition schedule and can plan accordingly.
* **Resource Allocation**: The ACA does not specify the resources required for a successful transition, including personnel, equipment, and budget. A clear understanding of the resources needed is crucial to ensure that the transition is executed smoothly.
* **Knowledge Transfer**: The ACA does not address the importance of knowledge transfer during the transition process. A comprehensive knowledge transfer plan is essential to ensure that critical business functions are not disrupted during the transition.
* **Data Migration Procedures**: While the ACA mentions data migration, it does not provide specific procedures or guidelines for ensuring data integrity and accuracy during the transition process. A well-planned data migration process is critical to ensure that business operations are not disrupted.

**Compliance Gap:**

The absence of comprehensive transition planning requirements in the ACA represents a compliance gap. To address this gap, the ACA should be amended to include explicit requirements for:

1. A detailed transition plan that outlines the scope of work, timelines, resource allocation, and key milestones.
2. A clear timeline for the transition process.
3. A clear understanding of the resources required for a successful transition, including personnel, equipment, and budget.
4. A comprehensive knowledge transfer plan to ensure that critical business functions are not disrupted during the transition.
5. Specific procedures and guidelines for data migration to ensure data integrity and accuracy during the transition process.

**Recommendation:**

To address the compliance gap, the ACA should be revised to include explicit requirements for comprehensive transition planning. This will ensure that customers and Atlassian can plan and execute transitions smoothly, minimizing disruptions to critical business functions."
