"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I have found no mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Therefore, I note the absence of this provision and flag it as a gap.

**Gap:** The contract does not include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider.

In the absence of such provisions, it is unclear whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. This gap may lead to difficulties in case the provider is unable to meet its obligations, as the customer may not have a clear understanding of their options for substitution.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider. This can be achieved by defining criteria for determining substitutability, such as:

* The provider's level of dependence on proprietary technology or intellectual property
* The complexity of the provider's systems and infrastructure
* The provider's ability to provide equivalent services and support
* The provider's reputation and track record of reliability and performance

By including such provisions, the contract can ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the substitutability of the provider and can take necessary steps to mitigate risks in case of non-performance or termination of the agreement."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","Based on the provided contract, it appears that the substitutability of third-party products or services is not explicitly defined. While the contract mentions that Customer may use third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products with the Atlassian products (Section 7.2, Third-Party Products), it does not provide specific criteria for determining substitutability.

To address this, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

1. Cost: Establish a threshold for the maximum acceptable cost of a third-party product or service, considering factors like total cost of ownership, maintenance, and support.
2. Technical specifications: Define the minimum technical requirements for compatibility, such as software versions, hardware specifications, or integration protocols.
3. Ease of transition: Establish a benchmark for the ease of transitioning from an existing product or service to a new one, considering factors like data migration, configuration, and training requirements.
4. Operational complexity: Define a threshold for the maximum acceptable level of operational complexity, considering factors like system dependencies, security risks, and scalability requirements.

Possible benchmarks based on industry standards could be:

* Cost: 10% to 20% above the current product or service cost, considering total cost of ownership and maintenance.
* Technical specifications: Compatibility with the latest software versions, hardware specifications, and integration protocols.
* Ease of transition: A maximum of 2-3 weeks for data migration, configuration, and training, with minimal disruption to business operations.
* Operational complexity: A maximum of 2-3 points on a 5-point scale, considering system dependencies, security risks, and scalability requirements.

By incorporating these criteria and benchmarks, the contract can provide a clearer understanding of what constitutes substitutability and enable more effective assessments and decision-making."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to documentation of alternative providers in the market:

* Section 7.1 Third-Party Code: This section mentions that Atlassian includes open source software and commercial third-party software in the Products. However, it does not require documentation of alternative providers.
* Section 7.2 Third-Party Products: This section states that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace. However, it does not require documentation of alternative providers.

There are no explicit clauses mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. However, Section 10.3 Return Policy mentions that Customer may terminate the Subscription Term for a Product within 30 days of its initial Order for a Product, and upon request, Atlassian will refund Customer the amount paid for that Product and any associated Support.

To address the missing documentation requirements, I recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This could be added to Section 7.1 Third-Party Code or Section 7.2 Third-Party Products. Here is a possible revised clause:

* Section 7.1 Third-Party Code: ""Customer acknowledges that Atlassian may include open source software and commercial third-party software in the Products. Customer agrees to maintain a list of alternative providers for each third-party software included in the Products and to update this list regularly to reflect changes in the market. The list of alternative providers must be provided to Atlassian upon request.""

This revised clause requires Customer to maintain a list of alternative providers for each third-party software included in the Products and to update this list regularly. This will ensure that Atlassian and Customer are aware of the available alternatives and can make informed decisions about their use of third-party software.

Alternatively, the revised clause could be added to Section 7.2 Third-Party Products:

* Section 7.2 Third-Party Products: ""Customer acknowledges that it may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace. Customer agrees to maintain a list of alternative providers for each third-party product used with the Products and to update this list regularly to reflect changes in the market. The list of alternative providers must be provided to Atlassian upon request.""

This revised clause requires Customer to maintain a list of alternative providers for each third-party product used with the Products and to update this list regularly. This will ensure that Atlassian and Customer are aware of the available alternatives and can make informed decisions about their use of third-party products."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I confirm that there are no provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. The agreement does not explicitly mandate a regular cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the financial, operational, and strategic implications of using Atlassian's products and services.

However, Section 10.1 (Fees) and Section 10.2 (Taxes) outline the payment terms and tax obligations, which may indirectly influence the cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) emphasizes the importance of complying with applicable laws, which may involve assessing the costs and benefits of different compliance strategies.

To maintain strategic flexibility and ensure that Customer is making informed decisions about their use of Atlassian's products and services, I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses. This could involve:

* Conducting a cost-benefit analysis at least annually to evaluate the financial, operational, and strategic implications of using Atlassian's products and services.
* Considering alternative providers and evaluating their costs, benefits, and risks.
* Assessing the impact of changes to the agreement, including any modifications to fees, taxes, or other terms.
* Documenting the results of the cost-benefit analysis and using the findings to inform strategic decisions about the use of Atlassian's products and services.

By incorporating these requirements, Customer can ensure that they are making informed decisions about their use of Atlassian's products and services, and that they are maintaining strategic flexibility to adapt to changing business needs."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that may be relevant to maintaining awareness of market alternatives:

**Section 6.2. Product Assessment**

* ""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use.""

While this clause does not explicitly require periodic market research, it implies that the customer has a responsibility to assess the suitability of the Atlassian products for their needs. However, it does not specify how this assessment should be conducted or how often it should be performed.

**Section 20.1. Compliance with Laws**

* ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

This clause is more focused on compliance with laws and regulations rather than market awareness. However, it may be argued that compliance with laws and regulations can involve staying informed about market trends and alternatives.

**Section 20.2. Code of Conduct**

* ""Atlassian must comply with its Code of Conduct in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

The Atlassian Code of Conduct is not explicitly mentioned in the provided document, but it is likely to include principles related to market awareness and competitiveness. However, the Code of Conduct is not a contractual requirement, and its content is not publicly available.

**Section 20.9. Changes to this Agreement**

* ""Atlassian may modify this Agreement (which includes the Policies, Product-Specific Terms and DPA) from time to time, by posting the modified portion(s) of this Agreement on Atlassian’s website.""

This clause allows Atlassian to modify the agreement, including policies and terms related to market awareness. However, it does not specify how often Atlassian will review or update these provisions.

**Validation**

Based on the provided clauses, it appears that the agreement does not explicitly require periodic market research or market awareness. However, some clauses imply a responsibility for customers to assess the suitability of Atlassian products for their needs, which may involve staying informed about market trends and alternatives.

**Recommendation**

To address the gap, I recommend adding a provision that requires periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. This could be included in a new section, such as:

**Section 6.3. Market Awareness**

* ""Atlassian and Customer agree to maintain awareness of market alternatives and emerging trends in the industry. To this end, Atlassian will conduct periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives and provide recommendations to Customer. The frequency and scope of these reviews will be determined by Atlassian, but shall not be less than annually.""

This provision would ensure that both Atlassian and Customer are aware of market developments and can make informed decisions about their partnership."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there is no specific requirement to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. However, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) mentions that Customer must not (and must not permit anyone else to) rent, lease, sell, distribute or sublicense the Products or include them in a service bureau or outsourcing offering. This suggests that Customer should have a clear understanding of its existing arrangements with the provider to ensure compliance with this restriction.

Additionally, Section 5.2 (License Verification) requires Customer to confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use upon Atlassian's written request. This implies that Customer should have a process in place to verify its existing arrangements with the provider to ensure compliance with the Scope of Use.

However, there is no explicit requirement to conduct a comprehensive review of existing arrangements, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. To address this gap, I recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract.

Specifically, the review should cover:

* The number of existing arrangements with the provider
* The type of arrangements (e.g., cloud, on-premise, subscription-based)
* The scope of each arrangement, including the features, functionality, and support provided
* Compliance with the Scope of Use and other contractual requirements

By conducting regular reviews, Customer can ensure that its existing arrangements with the provider are aligned with the contract terms and conditions, and make necessary adjustments to avoid any potential risks or non-compliance issues."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several provisions that require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Specifically, Section 7.2, ""Third-Party Products,"" mentions that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products""). This provision indicates that Atlassian is aware of the potential risks associated with using Third-Party Products and is taking steps to mitigate them.

However, upon further review, I have found that the contract does not explicitly require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Section 7.2 only mentions that Customer's use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider's terms of use, not this Agreement.

To address this gap, I suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers in the contract. This could be achieved by adding a provision that requires Atlassian to:

* Identify and document all closely connected providers, including those providing Third-Party Products
* Assess the risks associated with using these providers and their products
* Develop and implement procedures to mitigate these risks
* Regularly review and update the assessment and mitigation procedures to ensure they remain effective

By including these requirements, Atlassian can ensure that it is taking a proactive approach to managing risks associated with closely connected providers and maintaining a compliant relationship with its customers."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that relate to the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services:

* Section 20.13 Export Restrictions: This clause requires the customer to comply with all applicable export and import laws, including restrictions on exporting or re-exporting the Products or any direct product of the Products to certain jurisdictions or to restricted parties.
* Section 20.14 Government End-Users: This clause applies to government customers and requires them to comply with additional requirements, including the Government Amendment available at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/government-amendment.
* Section 20.15 No Contingencies: This clause states that the Products, Support, and Advisory Services are purchased separately and not contingent on the purchase or use of other Atlassian products and services.

However, I did not find any specific clause that requires tracking dependency on the provider or evaluating concentration risks. To address this, I recommend adding a section to the contract that requires the customer to analyze and address concentration risks. This section could be titled ""Concentration Risk Management"" and could include the following requirements:

* The customer must identify and assess the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services.
* The customer must develop a plan to mitigate concentration risks, including identifying alternative providers and implementing a risk management strategy.
* The customer must regularly review and update the concentration risk assessment to ensure that the plan remains effective.

Here is an example of what this section could look like:

**Concentration Risk Management**

The customer acknowledges that relying on a single provider for multiple services may pose concentration risks. To mitigate these risks, the customer agrees to:

* Identify and assess the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services.
* Develop a plan to mitigate concentration risks, including identifying alternative providers and implementing a risk management strategy.
* Regularly review and update the concentration risk assessment to ensure that the plan remains effective.

By adding this section, the contract can help ensure that the customer is aware of the concentration risks associated with relying on a single provider and takes steps to mitigate those risks."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider:

**Section 7.2: Third-Party Products**

""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.""

This provision acknowledges that third-party products may be used in conjunction with Atlassian's products, but it does not explicitly assess the interdependencies between these services.

**Section 7.1: Third-Party Code**

""This Agreement and the Third-Party Code Policy apply to open source software and commercial third-party software Atlassian includes in the Products.""

This provision mentions third-party code, but it does not specifically address interdependencies between services.

**Section 20.13: Export Restrictions**

""The Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. Customer must comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products.""

This provision mentions export restrictions, but it does not assess interdependencies between services.

**Section 15.5: Exceptions**

""Atlassian’s obligations in this Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) do not apply to the extent an Infringement Claim arises from: (a) Customer’s modification or unauthorized use of the Products, (b) use of the Products in combination with items not provided by Atlassian (including Third-Party Products), (c) any unsupported release of the Software Products or Cloud Clients, or (d) Third-Party Products, Customer Data or Customer Materials.""

This provision mentions the use of third-party products in combination with Atlassian's products, but it does not assess the interdependencies between these services.

Based on these provisions, it appears that Atlassian acknowledges the use of third-party products and code in conjunction with its products, but it does not explicitly assess the interdependencies between these services. Therefore, I suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks to ensure that customers are aware of potential risks and can take necessary precautions.

**Recommendation:**

Atlassian should consider adding a provision that requires an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This could include:

* A requirement for customers to conduct a risk assessment of third-party products and services used in conjunction with Atlassian's products
* A provision that Atlassian will provide guidance on how to mitigate potential risks associated with interdependent services
* A clause that Atlassian will not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use of third-party products or services in conjunction with its products, unless the customer has conducted a thorough risk assessment and taken necessary precautions.

By including such a provision, Atlassian can help customers understand the potential risks associated with interdependent services and take necessary steps to mitigate those risks."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","**Compliance Evaluation:**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there is a lack of provisions that address the provider's market share and concentration risk. This is a significant gap, as it may leave the customer vulnerable to monopoly risks and limited alternatives in the event of a disruption or termination of services.

**Highlighted Gap:**

The agreement does not contain any clauses that specifically evaluate or address the provider's market share and concentration risk. This omission is concerning, as it may impact the customer's ability to assess and mitigate potential risks associated with relying on a single provider.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I recommend that the agreement be modified to include terms that assess the provider's market share and concentration risk. This could be achieved by:

1. Adding a clause that requires the provider to disclose its market share and concentration risk metrics.
2. Including a provision that evaluates the provider's market share and concentration risk and identifies potential mitigation strategies.
3. Requiring the provider to maintain a minimum level of competition or ensure that customers have access to alternative providers.

**Example of Additional Terms:**

To address the provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience, the following terms could be added to the agreement:

* ""Market Share Disclosure"": The Provider shall disclose its market share and concentration risk metrics to the Customer upon request.
* ""Concentration Risk Assessment"": The Provider shall conduct a concentration risk assessment and provide a report to the Customer within [insert timeframe].
* ""Resilience Requirements"": The Provider shall maintain a minimum level of competition and ensure that Customers have access to alternative providers in the event of a disruption or termination of services.

By incorporating these terms, the agreement can better address the provider's market share and concentration risk, ensuring that the customer is aware of and prepared for potential risks associated with relying on a single provider."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","After reviewing the contract, I confirm that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. However, the contract does address some location-specific factors, such as:

* The contract specifies that the agreement will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland or the State of California, depending on the customer's location (Section 20.4).
* The contract mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions (Section 20.13).
* The contract requires the customer to comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products (Section 20.13).

However, these provisions do not specifically address geographical concentration risks or location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.

To mitigate geographical concentration risks, I recommend including a geographical risk assessment in the contract. This could involve:

* Identifying potential risks associated with the provider's operations in specific locations, such as natural disasters, infrastructure reliability, or regulatory requirements.
* Assessing the provider's contingency plans and business continuity arrangements in the event of a geographical risk event.
* Requiring the provider to provide regular updates on its geographical risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

By including a geographical risk assessment in the contract, the customer can better understand the potential risks associated with the provider's operations and ensure that the provider has adequate measures in place to mitigate these risks."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","**Compliance Findings: EU Data Protection Regulations**

After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses related to third-country providers and data protection regulations. The findings are as follows:

**Clause 4.2 (Security Program)**

Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This program includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.

**Clause 4.2 (Security Program) - Validation**

This clause ensures that Atlassian's security program is designed to protect Customer Data, but it does not explicitly mention compliance with EU data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While Atlassian's security program may align with GDPR requirements, it is essential to clarify this explicitly to ensure third-country providers comply with EU data protection rules.

**Clause 6.3 (Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA)**

Unless the parties have entered into a 'Business Associate Agreement,' Customer must not (and must not permit anyone else to) upload to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to process) any patient, medical, or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

**Clause 6.3 (Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA) - Validation**

This clause specifically mentions HIPAA, which is a US data protection regulation. However, it does not explicitly require compliance with EU data protection regulations. To ensure third-country providers comply with EU data protection rules, it is essential to include a provision that explicitly mentions GDPR or other relevant EU data protection regulations.

**Recommendation**

To address the absence of explicit EU data protection regulations compliance, I suggest including the following clause:

**Clause [Insert new clause number] (EU Data Protection Compliance)**

Atlassian requires all third-country providers to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable EU data protection regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring data protection by design and default, providing transparency and accountability, and implementing measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data.

By including this clause, Atlassian can ensure that third-country providers comply with EU data protection regulations, providing an additional layer of protection for Customer Data."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses that assess the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, particularly in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance. Specifically, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) states that:

""If Customer is domiciled: (i) in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland, with the jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement in the courts of the Republic of Ireland, or (ii) elsewhere, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, with the jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement in the state and United States federal courts located in San Francisco, California.""

This clause establishes the governing law and jurisdiction for disputes arising from the Agreement, which is essential for ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.

However, I recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider's country. This could include:

* A clause that requires the provider to notify the customer of any changes to the governing law or jurisdiction that may impact the Agreement.
* A provision that allows the customer to terminate the Agreement if the provider's country experiences a significant change in its laws or regulations that negatively impacts the customer's use of the provider's services.
* A clause that requires the provider to maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect against potential risks and liabilities in its country of operation.

Additionally, the provider could consider including a clause that requires the customer to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in the provider's country, while also ensuring that the customer's rights and obligations are protected.

Overall, incorporating these provisions would help to mitigate legal risks and ensure that the Agreement is enforceable in the provider's jurisdiction."
"Search for clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. Extract these terms for verification.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions:

1. **Section 4.1: Customer Data**: Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement. This implies that Customer Data may be stored and processed in various jurisdictions, including third-country locations.
2. **Section 4.2: Security Program**: Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, this clause does not explicitly address data localization requirements.
3. **Section 4.5: Removals and Suspension**: Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the Cloud Products, if Atlassian becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others. This clause implies that Atlassian may need to comply with data localization requirements in various jurisdictions.
4. **Section 20.13: Export Restrictions**: The Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. Customer must comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products. This clause addresses export restrictions but does not explicitly address data localization requirements.

**Verification and Recommendations**

While the Atlassian Customer Agreement addresses various aspects of data processing and security, it lacks explicit provisions for data localization requirements. To align with regulatory and operational needs, I recommend adding data localization provisions to the agreement, such as:

* Specifying the jurisdictions where Customer Data will be stored and processed
* Outlining the measures to be taken to ensure compliance with data localization requirements in various jurisdictions
* Establishing procedures for handling data requests from regulatory authorities in third-country jurisdictions

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that its data processing practices align with regulatory requirements and minimize associated risks in third-country jurisdictions."
"Search for provisions assessing country-specific operational risks (e.g., political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues). Highlight gaps in the contract if such assessments are not required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a notable absence of provisions assessing country-specific operational risks. The contract primarily focuses on general compliance requirements, intellectual property rights, and liability limitations, but it does not explicitly address potential risks associated with operating in specific countries.

This lack of consideration for country-specific risks creates a gap in the contract, particularly for customers operating in regions with high political instability, complex legal frameworks, or inadequate infrastructure. Such risks can significantly impact the customer's ability to use the Atlassian products and services, and the company's overall business operations.

To address this gap, I recommend adding a clause that requires Atlassian to assess and mitigate country-specific operational risks. This could include:

* Conducting a risk assessment for each country where the customer operates
* Identifying potential risks, such as regulatory compliance issues, data protection concerns, or infrastructure limitations
* Developing strategies to mitigate these risks, including providing support for customers in high-risk countries
* Regularly reviewing and updating the risk assessment to ensure compliance with changing regulatory requirements

By incorporating such provisions, the contract can better address the unique challenges and risks associated with operating in different countries, ensuring a more comprehensive and compliant agreement for both Atlassian and its customers."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider. Confirm if these assessments are mandated on a defined schedule (e.g., quarterly or annually). Extract and validate the relevant provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.","**Compliance Findings:**

After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I confirm that there is no explicit clause mandating regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider. However, I did find a provision that requires Atlassian to maintain an information security program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures (Section 4.2).

**Extracted Provision:**

4.2 Security Program. Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures. Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures. Further information about Atlassian’s security program is available on the Atlassian Trust Center at https://www.atlassian.com/trust, as updated from time to time.

**Validation:**

While the provision mentions independent third-party audits and certifications, it does not specify a regular schedule for these assessments. Therefore, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.

**Recommendation:**

To address this compliance gap, I suggest adding a clause that requires Atlassian to conduct regular critical risk assessments on a defined schedule, such as quarterly or annually. This will ensure that Atlassian maintains a robust information security program and identifies potential risks to Customer Data.

**Proposed Clause:**

Atlassian shall conduct regular critical risk assessments of its information security program, including assessments of its third-party providers, at least once per annum. These assessments shall be conducted by independent third-party auditors and shall include an evaluation of Atlassian's compliance with the Security Measures. The results of these assessments shall be documented and shared with Customer upon request.

By adding this clause, Atlassian will be required to regularly assess its critical risks and take steps to mitigate them, ensuring the continued operational resilience of its information security program."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified that the contract does not explicitly specify risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. While the contract mentions the possibility of Atlassian suspending Customer's rights to use Products or receive Support or Advisory Services if payment is overdue (Section 10.4), this is not a proactive risk mitigation measure.

Moreover, the contract does not outline contingency plans, redundancies, or alternative providers in the event of a critical risk or failure. Section 20.10 (Force Majeure) mentions that neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement due to events beyond its reasonable control and occurring without that party's fault or negligence. However, this provision does not provide a clear plan for mitigating risks or ensuring business continuity.

To address this gap, I recommend adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. This could include:

* Contingency plans for critical risks, such as data breaches or system outages
* Redundancies for essential systems or services

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is clear that there is a need to establish a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations. The contract does not explicitly specify monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements, which is a critical gap in ensuring the effective management of risks.

To address this gap, it is recommended that provisions for continuous monitoring be included in the contract. This can be achieved by specifying tools or metrics that will be used to monitor the provider's performance, such as service availability, response times, and other key performance indicators (KPIs). Additionally, the contract should outline the frequency of monitoring, including regular check-ins and reviews to ensure that the provider is meeting its obligations.

Specifically, the contract should include requirements for:

* Regular monitoring of service availability, response times, and other KPIs to ensure that the provider is meeting its performance obligations
* Use of specific monitoring tools, such as dashboards, reports, or APIs, to track performance metrics
* Frequency of monitoring, including regular check-ins and reviews to ensure that the provider is meeting its obligations
* Reporting requirements, including regular updates on performance metrics and any issues or concerns that may arise

By including these provisions, the contract will provide a clear framework for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations, ensuring that the customer is well-positioned to manage and mitigate any potential risks that may arise."

Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer’s use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer’s Scope of Use, provided Atlassian gives Customer reasonable advance notice and uses reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Customer.

This clause implies that Atlassian may conduct audits to verify compliance with the Scope of Use, which could lead to reassessment of risks associated with the use of the Software Products. However, this clause does not explicitly require regular reassessment of risks triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals.

**Validation**

To validate this clause, I would suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals. This could be achieved by adding a new clause, such as:

**Section 5.3. Dynamic Risk Reassessment**

Customer acknowledges that Atlassian's operations, market conditions, and technological advancements may change over time, which may impact the risks associated with the use of the Software Products. Therefore, Customer agrees to participate in regular risk reassessments with Atlassian, triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals (e.g., every 6 months). These reassessments will be conducted to ensure that the risks associated with the use of the Software Products remain within acceptable limits.

As a compliance officer, it is essential to identify provisions that address the assessment of technological lock-in risks, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies. Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following relevant clauses:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions): This clause prohibits Customer from developing a similar or competing product or service using the Products, which may indicate a potential lock-in risk.
* Section 5.1 (Modifications): This clause allows Atlassian to provide source code for Customer to create bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications, which may create a dependency on Atlassian's proprietary technology.
* Section 5.2 (License Verification): This clause allows Atlassian to audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the Scope of Use, which may indicate a potential lock-in risk due to the complexity of the audit process.
* Section 9 (Ordering Process and Delivery): This clause specifies that no Order is binding until Atlassian provides its acceptance, which may indicate a potential lock-in risk due to the lack of transparency in the ordering process.

To address these concerns, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies. This could include:

* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide a clear and transparent assessment of the risks of vendor lock-in, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies.
* A clause that specifies potential exit strategies, such as a clear process for transferring data and applications to a new provider, in the event that Customer wishes to switch providers.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide regular updates on any changes to its proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies, to ensure that Customer is aware of any potential lock-in risks.

However, I have found that these dependencies are not explicitly documented or monitored in the agreement. For instance, Section 5.1 does not provide clear guidelines on how Customer should evaluate and document the dependencies on proprietary technologies, such as custom software or unique configurations.

To address this, I recommend adding provisions to the agreement that require Customer to evaluate and document dependencies on proprietary technologies. This can be achieved by incorporating a clause that outlines the following:

* Customer's responsibilities for documenting and monitoring proprietary technology dependencies
* The process for evaluating and mitigating risks associated with these dependencies
* The procedures for updating and maintaining documentation on proprietary technology dependencies

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that Customer is aware of and takes responsibility for managing proprietary technology dependencies, which can help prevent potential compliance risks and ensure a smooth operation of the Software Products.

This assessment should consider risks to operational continuity and identify potential mitigation strategies.

Specifically, the revised clause could require Atlassian to:

* Conduct regular assessments of technological changes and their potential impact on substitutability and operational continuity
* Identify and mitigate risks associated with these changes, including impacts on data security, system reliability, and customer experience
* Provide transparent communication to customers about changes that may affect their use of the services or systems

Customer agrees to conduct regular resilience testing of its BCDR plans, including scenario-based exercises and live drills, to ensure the effectiveness of its disaster recovery and business continuity procedures. The purpose of this testing is to identify and address potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in Customer's BCDR plans.

6.2. Frequency and Scope. Customer shall conduct resilience testing at least once every six months, or as otherwise specified in the Order, and shall test all critical systems and processes that are essential to its business operations.

6.3. Reporting. Customer shall provide Atlassian with a written report of the results of each resilience test, including any findings, recommendations, and action items. Atlassian may request additional information or clarification on the report as needed.""

This proposed addition would require Customer to conduct regular resilience testing of its BCDR plans, with specified frequency and scope, and to report the results to Atlassian. This would help ensure that Customer's BCDR plans are effective and up-to-date, and that any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses are identified and addressed in a timely manner."

Atlassian may also take any such measures where required by Law, or at the request of a governmental authority. When practicable, Atlassian will give Customer the opportunity to remedy the issue before taking any such measures.""

However, this provision does not specify any specific timelines for incident reporting in the event of ICT disruptions or security incidents. It only mentions that Atlassian will give Customer the opportunity to remedy the issue ""when practicable.""

Regulatory requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require organizations to report high-severity incidents to the relevant authorities within 72 hours (not 24 hours). The absence of clear incident reporting timelines in the Atlassian Customer Agreement may not align with these regulatory requirements.

I recommend including clear timelines for incident reporting in the agreement, such as:

* For low-severity incidents: within 24 hours
* For medium-severity incidents: within 48 hours
* For high-severity incidents: within 72 hours

This will ensure that Atlassian can meet regulatory requirements and maintain transparency with its customers in the event of ICT disruptions or security incidents."
"Identify whether the contract includes escalation procedures for incidents, specifying the hierarchy and communication protocols for escalating issues to higher management or relevant stakeholders. Extract and verify these terms.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding an escalation matrix with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines for each escalation stage.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract does not explicitly outline escalation procedures for incidents, including a hierarchy and communication protocols for escalating issues to higher management or relevant stakeholders.

Upon reviewing the contract, I found that Section 8, ""Support and Advisory Services,"" mentions that Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies. However, it does not specify escalation procedures for incidents.

To address this compliance gap, I recommend adding an escalation matrix with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines for each escalation stage. This will ensure that incidents are handled promptly and efficiently, and that relevant stakeholders are notified and involved in a timely manner.

**Suggested Escalation Matrix:**

| Escalation Stage | Roles | Responsibilities | Timelines |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Customer Support Team | Respond to customer inquiries, troubleshoot issues, and provide basic support | 1-2 hours |
| Level 2 | Technical Support Team | Investigate and resolve complex technical issues | 2-4 hours |
| Level 3 | Senior Technical Support Team | Escalate critical issues to senior technical support team for further investigation and resolution | 4-8 hours |
| Level 4 | Management | Escalate critical issues to management for review and decision-making | 8 hours or less |

**Communication Protocols:**

* Level 1: Customer Support Team will communicate with the customer via email, phone, or chat.
* Level 2: Technical Support Team will communicate with the customer via email or phone.
* Level 3: Senior Technical Support Team will communicate with the customer via email or phone.
* Level 4: Management will communicate with the customer via email or phone.

**Verification:**

To verify the effectiveness of the escalation matrix, I recommend the following:

* Regularly review and update the escalation matrix to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
* Conduct regular training sessions for the support teams to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities.
* Monitor and analyze incident reports to identify areas for improvement in the escalation process.
* Conduct customer satisfaction surveys to gauge the effectiveness of the escalation matrix in resolving customer issues."
"Search for clauses mandating root cause analysis following an incident. Validate whether the contract specifies timelines for completing the analysis and sharing findings with the financial entity.

Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including terms requiring a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clause related to incident management and root cause analysis:

**Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination)**

""...Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or a Subscription Term: (a) Customer’s rights to use the applicable Products, Support or Advisory Services will cease, (b) Customer must immediately cease accessing the Cloud Products and using the applicable Software Products and Cloud Clients, and (c) Customer must delete (or, on request, return) all license keys, access keys and any Product copies.""

However, I did not find a specific clause mandating root cause analysis following an incident. Nevertheless, I suggest that the contract should include terms requiring a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents to ensure transparency and accountability.

**Recommendation:**

To enhance compliance and incident management, I recommend including the following terms in the contract:

* A clause mandating a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents, including timelines for completion and sharing findings with the financial entity.
* A requirement for Atlassian to conduct a thorough investigation and provide a detailed report on the root cause of the incident, including any necessary corrective actions.
* A provision for regular updates and communication with the financial entity on the progress of the root cause analysis and any resulting changes to the Products or services.

This will ensure that both parties are held accountable for incident management and that the financial entity is kept informed of any issues or concerns that may impact their business.

**Timeline for Root Cause Analysis:**

The contract should specify a reasonable timeline for completing the root cause analysis, such as:

* Within 30 days of the incident, Atlassian must conduct a preliminary investigation and provide an initial report to the financial entity.
* Within 60 days of the incident, Atlassian must complete a detailed root cause analysis and provide a final report to the financial entity, including any necessary corrective actions.

**Sharing Findings with the Financial Entity:**

The contract should also specify that Atlassian must share the findings of the root cause analysis with the financial entity, including any necessary corrective actions. This will ensure that the financial entity is kept informed of any issues or concerns that may impact their business.

In summary, while the contract does not currently mandate root cause analysis following an incident, I recommend including terms that require a detailed analysis to ensure transparency and accountability. The contract should also specify timelines for completing the analysis and sharing findings with the financial entity."

If Atlassian determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the affected Subscription Term. Atlassian will then refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.

However, I could not find a specific timeline or scope for these corrective measures in the contract. Section 11.2 only mentions that Atlassian will use ""reasonable efforts"" to correct the non-conformity, without specifying a timeframe or scope for the corrective actions.

To address this gap, I suggest including a clause mandating timely implementation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents. This could be achieved by adding a new provision, such as:

""11.3 Corrective Actions: In the event of a breach of a Performance Warranty, Atlassian shall implement corrective actions within a timeframe of [insert timeframe, e.g. 30 days] to prevent recurrence of the incident. The scope of the corrective actions shall include [insert scope, e.g. modifying the affected Product feature, providing additional training to Users, etc.].

**Operational Resilience Measures for Critical Functions:**

1. **Section 4.2 (Security Program)**: Atlassian's security program includes measures to protect Customer Data, such as encryption, access controls, and incident response procedures.
2. **Section 5.1 (Modifications)**: Atlassian may provide source code for certain Software Products, allowing Customers to create bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications.
3. **Section 6.2 (Product Assessment)**: Customers are responsible for determining whether the Products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Add a compliance clause:** Include a clause that explicitly states Atlassian's compliance with DORA regulations and the operational resilience measures in place for critical functions.
2. **Define critical functions:** Identify the critical functions within the Products and Services that require operational resilience measures, such as data processing, customer support, and incident response.

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business, but it does not specifically mention BCDR planning or updates.
* Section 20.2 (Code of Conduct) requires Atlassian to comply with its Code of Conduct, which may include BCDR planning and updates, but it is not explicitly stated.

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices, I recommend adding a requirement for periodic updates to BCDR plans, ideally every 6-12 months or after significant operational changes. This will help ensure that the organization's BCDR plans remain relevant, effective, and aligned with changing business needs.

**Periodic Update Requirements:** To implement this recommendation, the following details should be added to the BCDR plan:

* Schedule regular reviews and updates of the BCDR plan every 6-12 months or after significant operational changes.
* Involve relevant stakeholders, including IT, operations, and management, in the review and update process.
* Document changes, updates, and decisions made during the review process.

* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) states that Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party.

However, I have not found any specific incident reporting timelines in the agreement. The agreement does not specify a timeframe for reporting incidents or breaches to Atlassian or to regulatory authorities. This is a gap in the agreement, as regulatory standards typically require timely reporting of incidents to ensure prompt mitigation and minimize harm.

For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires merchants to report card data breaches to the affected cardholders and to the relevant card brands within a specific timeframe (typically 72 hours). Similarly, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data controllers to notify the relevant supervisory authority of a personal data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.

To align with regulatory standards, I recommend that the agreement include specific incident reporting timelines, such as:

* A timeframe for reporting incidents to Atlassian (e.g., within 24 hours)
* A timeframe for reporting incidents to regulatory authorities (e.g., within 72 hours)
* A requirement for Atlassian to notify Customer in the event of a security incident or breach

However, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the agreement.

While this section does not outline a specific risk assessment process for subcontractors, it does state that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under the agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under the agreement.

This implies that Atlassian may conduct some level of risk assessment and due diligence on its subcontractors, but the specifics of this process are not detailed in the contract.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure a robust third-party risk management process, I suggest adding a mandatory subcontractor risk assessment process as part of the overall risk management framework. This could include criteria for assessing financial, operational, and compliance risks associated with subcontractors, such as:

* Financial risk: assessment of subcontractor's financial stability, creditworthiness, and ability to meet payment obligations
* Operational risk: evaluation of subcontractor's operational capacity, quality control processes, and ability to meet performance requirements
* Compliance risk: assessment of subcontractor's adherence to relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, as well as their ability to maintain confidentiality and data security

By incorporating a subcontractor risk assessment process into the agreement, Atlassian can better ensure that its subcontractors are capable of meeting the required standards and minimizing potential risks to the business."

Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding clauses mandating a comprehensive review of subcontracting chain length and complexity, emphasizing operational and regulatory risks.","After reviewing the contract, I found that the provision related to subcontracting chains is Section 20.11, which states: ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

However, I did not find any specific provisions that require the evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains, including the number of subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion. Therefore, I would recommend adding clauses mandating a comprehensive review of subcontracting chain length and complexity to mitigate operational and regulatory risks.

Here is a suggested addition to Section 20.11:

""20.11.1 Atlassian shall conduct a regular review of its subcontracting chain, including the number of subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion, to ensure that the risks associated with subcontracting are properly assessed and mitigated.

20.11.2 The review shall consider the following factors:

* The number of subcontractors involved in the performance of the Agreement
* The dependencies between subcontractors and the complexity of the subcontracting chain
* The geographical dispersion of subcontractors and the potential impact on data protection, security, and regulatory compliance
* The operational and regulatory risks associated with subcontracting, including the potential for data breaches, non-compliance with laws and regulations, and reputational damage

20.11.3 Atlassian shall maintain records of the review and shall provide them to Customer upon request.

20.11.4 Atlassian shall implement measures to mitigate any identified risks and shall ensure that its subcontractors comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.

20.11.5 Customer reserves the right to review and audit Atlassian's subcontracting chain to ensure compliance with this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations.""

By adding these provisions, the contract would require Atlassian to conduct a comprehensive review of its subcontracting chain and to take measures to mitigate any identified risks. This would help to ensure that the operational and regulatory risks associated with subcontracting are properly assessed and mitigated, and would provide Customer with greater assurance that Atlassian is meeting its obligations under the Agreement."

**Clause 20.11 Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

This clause indicates that Atlassian acknowledges the use of subcontractors and Affiliates in its operations, but it does not provide specific details on how these subcontractors are monitored or managed.

**Recommendation**

To enhance compliance throughout the subcontracting chain, I recommend including requirements for regular chain monitoring, such as reporting structures or dedicated monitoring resources. This could be achieved by adding a clause similar to the following:

""Atlassian shall establish and maintain a system to monitor and report on the performance of its subcontractors and Affiliates, including regular audits and assessments to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Atlassian shall provide Customer with access to such monitoring and reporting mechanisms, as well as any relevant documentation or information, upon request.""

However, this section does not explicitly require Atlassian to disclose the names and roles of all subcontractors, nor does it mandate disclosure of changes to the subcontracting structure.

To ensure transparency in subcontracting chains, I recommend adding clauses to the agreement that require Atlassian to disclose the following information:

* Names and roles of all subcontractors: This will enable the customer to understand who is performing the work and ensure that they meet the required standards.
* Changes to the subcontracting structure: This will allow the customer to be aware of any changes that may impact the quality or reliability of the services provided.
* Right to access this information: The customer should have the right to request and obtain information about the subcontracting chain, including the names and roles of subcontractors, and any changes to the subcontracting structure.

This is a gap in the contract, and I recommend including a clause that requires timely notification of any changes in the subcontracting structure.

**Re-Assessment of Risks for New Subcontractors or Structural Changes:**
The contract does not specify a process for re-assessing risks for new subcontractors or structural changes. Section 20.11 only mentions that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors. This provision does not address the need for a re-assessment of risks associated with new subcontractors or structural changes.

To address these gaps, I recommend including the following clauses in the contract:

* ""Atlassian shall provide timely notification to Customer of any changes in the subcontracting chain, including the addition or removal of subcontractors or structural changes. Such notification shall be provided in writing and shall include details of the changes, including the identity of any new subcontractors and their roles and responsibilities.""
* ""Upon receipt of notification of changes in the subcontracting chain, Customer may request a re-assessment of the risks associated with such changes.

* Limit subcontracting to specific geographic regions or countries, if necessary, to comply with data protection or other regulatory requirements.
* Identify critical functions that cannot be subcontracted, such as data processing or security services, to ensure that Atlassian maintains control over sensitive operations.
* Require subcontractors to adhere to the same data protection, security, and confidentiality standards as Atlassian.
* Establish procedures for Atlassian to monitor and oversee subcontractors' performance to ensure compliance with the Agreement.

However, there is no mention of monitoring or auditing subcontractors to ensure compliance with the Agreement or applicable laws. This lack of monitoring requirement may leave a gap in Atlassian's compliance obligations.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, it is recommended that the Agreement be amended to include monitoring requirements for subcontractors. Specifically, Section 20.11 could be revised to include language such as:

**Criteria for risk assessment:**

1. **Reputation and track record**: Evaluate the subcontractor's past performance, reputation, and experience in delivering similar services.
2. **Financial stability**: Assess the subcontractor's financial health, including their creditworthiness, solvency, and ability to meet their financial obligations.
3. **Security and data protection**: Evaluate the subcontractor's security and data protection practices, including their compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards.
4. **Compliance with laws and regulations**: Assess the subcontractor's compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards, including data protection, labor laws, and environmental regulations.
5. **Insurance and liability**: Evaluate the subcontractor's insurance coverage and liability policies to ensure they are adequate to cover potential risks.

**Scope of risk assessment:**

1. **Initial assessment**: Conduct an initial risk assessment before engaging a subcontractor to evaluate their suitability for the project.
2. **Ongoing monitoring**: Regularly monitor the subcontractor's performance and risk profile throughout the project to identify any potential issues.
3. **Risk mitigation**: Implement measures to mitigate identified risks, such as requiring the subcontractor to implement additional security controls or providing additional training.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Develop a risk assessment template**: Create a template to standardize the risk assessment process and ensure consistency across all subcontractor evaluations.
2. **Establish a risk assessment committee**: Form a committee to oversee the risk assessment process and ensure that all risks are properly identified and mitigated.
3. **Conduct regular audits**: Regularly audit subcontractors to ensure they are meeting their obligations and to identify any potential risks.
4. **Update the agreement**: Update the Atlassian Customer Agreement to include a provision mandating the risk assessment of subcontractors.

By implementing a robust risk assessment process for subcontractors, Atlassian can ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, mitigate potential risks, and maintain a strong reputation in the industry."

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

This clause does not specify the number of subcontractors or their geographical dispersion, which may lead to complexity and compliance risks. To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to add a requirement for Atlassian to maintain a subcontractor management program that ensures:

* Clear communication and coordination among subcontractors
* Regular audits and assessments of subcontractor performance
* Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
* Transparency and accountability in subcontractor relationships

**Clause 20.11(b): Assignment**

Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian’s prior written consent.

This clause does not address the assignment of obligations to subcontractors, which may lead to confusion and compliance risks. To clarify, it is recommended to add a provision that requires Atlassian to obtain Customer’s consent before assigning any obligations to subcontractors.

**Recommendation**

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and contractual obligations, it is recommended to add the following requirement to clause 20.11:

""Atlassian shall maintain a subcontractor management program that ensures clear communication and coordination among subcontractors, regular audits and assessments of subcontractor performance, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and transparency and accountability in subcontractor relationships. Atlassian shall provide Customer with regular updates on subcontractor performance and any changes to the subcontractor management program.""

2.  **Subcontractor Onboarding**: Atlassian should require its subcontractors to provide documentation of their own compliance programs, including policies, procedures, and training materials. This will help Atlassian assess the subcontractor's ability to meet the Agreement's requirements.
3.  **Subcontractor Reporting**: Atlassian should require its subcontractors to provide regular reports on their performance, including metrics on security, data protection, and compliance with the Agreement.
4.  **Subcontractor Termination**: Atlassian should have a clear process for terminating subcontractor relationships if they fail to meet the Agreement's requirements or if there is a breach of contract.
5.  **Subcontractor Escalation**: Atlassian should establish an escalation process for addressing subcontractor-related issues, including reporting security incidents or data breaches.
