"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clauses that relate to the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Retained Responsibility**

* Section 20.1 ""Compliance with Laws"" states that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This implies that the financial entity retains responsibility for complying with DORA obligations.
* Section 20.1 also mentions that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This suggests that even if Atlassian outsources some responsibilities, the financial entity remains responsible for ensuring that Atlassian complies with DORA obligations.

**References to DORA Obligations**

* There are no explicit references to DORA obligations in the agreement. However, Section 4.2 ""Security Program"" mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This section does not specifically mention DORA, but it implies that Atlassian is taking steps to ensure the security of Customer Data, which is a key aspect of DORA compliance.

**Non-Transfer of Compliance Obligations**

* Section 20.3 ""Assignment"" states that ""Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian’s prior written consent."" This implies that the financial entity cannot transfer its DORA compliance obligations to Atlassian without Atlassian's consent.

**Acknowledgment that Outsourcing Doesn't Diminish Entity's Responsibility**

* Section 20.1 ""Compliance with Laws"" states that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This acknowledges that outsourcing some responsibilities to subcontractors or Affiliates does not diminish Atlassian's (and by extension, the financial entity's) responsibility for DORA compliance.

In summary, while the agreement does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, the clauses mentioned above imply that the financial entity remains responsible for ensuring that Atlassian complies with DORA obligations, even if Atlassian outsources some responsibilities."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:
 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that Atlassian, the financial entity, has a comprehensive framework in place for compliance with various financial services laws and regulations. However, there are a few areas where additional clarity and explicit statements would enhance the contract's compliance.

**Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations**: The contract mentions compliance with various laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), but it does not explicitly state that it covers all applicable financial services laws. To address this, I recommend adding a clause that acknowledges Atlassian's responsibility to comply with all relevant financial services laws and regulations.

**Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities**: The contract does not explicitly state that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers. To ensure that Atlassian retains full responsibility for regulatory compliance, I recommend adding a clause that prohibits the delegation of regulatory responsibilities.

**Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations**: While the contract mentions ongoing obligations, it does not explicitly state that Atlassian will continue to comply with financial services laws and regulations throughout the duration of the agreement. To address this, I recommend adding a clause that acknowledges Atlassian's ongoing regulatory obligations.

**References to specific financial services laws**: The contract mentions HIPAA, but it does not explicitly reference other relevant financial services laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules. To ensure that Atlassian is compliant with all relevant financial services laws, I recommend adding explicit references to these laws and regulations.

To address these areas, I recommend adding the following clause:

**Retention of Regulatory Responsibilities**: Atlassian acknowledges and agrees that it retains full responsibility for compliance with all applicable financial services laws and regulations, including but not limited to [list specific laws and regulations, such as HIPAA, GLBA, and FINRA rules]. Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers and will continue to comply with all relevant financial services laws and regulations throughout the duration of this agreement.

This clause will provide clear and explicit statements regarding Atlassian's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws, ensuring that the contract is comprehensive and compliant with regulatory requirements."

* Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) mentions that the Agreement will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland or California, depending on the Customer's domicile. However, there is no provision for senior management or board approval of this governing law clause.

**Review Procedures:**

* Section 20.5 (Notices) requires that notices under this Agreement must be in writing and are deemed given on personal delivery, receipt by a recognized overnight courier, or the third business day after mailing. However, there is no provision for regular review of these notices or approval procedures.

**Documentation of Approvals:**

* Section 20.6 (Entire Agreement) states that this Agreement is the parties' entire agreement regarding its subject matter and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements. However, there is no provision for documenting approvals or changes to the Agreement.

**Renewal Approval Processes:**

* Section 10.1 (Fees) mentions that a Subscription Term will automatically renew at Atlassian's then-current rates for another Subscription Term of a period equal to Customer's prior Subscription Term, or 12 months if the prior Subscription Term was for 12 months or more. However, there is no provision for senior management or board approval of these renewal terms.

**Governance Gap:**

Based on the review, I have identified a governance gap related to the lack of explicit board/senior management approval requirements for assignments, governing law, notices, documentation of approvals, and renewal terms. I recommend adding explicit board/senior management approval requirements to ensure that these critical decisions are properly authorized and documented.

**Recommendation:**

To address this governance gap, I suggest adding the following provisions to the Atlassian Customer Agreement:

* Senior management or board approval requirements for assignments, governing law, and renewal terms
* Regular review procedures for notices and changes to the Agreement
* Documentation of approvals and changes to the Agreement
* Explicit approval processes for renewal terms and governing law clauses

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that its agreements are properly authorized and documented, and that senior management and the board are aware of and approve critical decisions related to ICT service agreements."
"Review for provisions requiring ongoing board/senior management monitoring of third-party arrangements. Verify:
 • Regular review requirements
 • Monitoring frequency

Follow-up if Missing: Suggest adding structured monitoring requirements with specific timelines and metrics.","Compliance Review: Third-Party Arrangements Monitoring

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires ongoing monitoring of third-party arrangements, specifically with regards to the use of Third-Party Products with the Products. However, the agreement lacks specific provisions for regular review requirements, monitoring frequency, performance metrics, and reporting requirements to senior management.

**Regular Review Requirements**: The agreement does not specify when or how often Atlassian will review third-party arrangements. It is essential to establish a regular review schedule to ensure that Atlassian's third-party arrangements are operating effectively and in compliance with the agreement.

**Monitoring Frequency**: The agreement does not provide a specific frequency for monitoring third-party arrangements. A suggested monitoring frequency could be quarterly or bi-annually, depending on the complexity and risk associated with each arrangement.

**Performance Metrics**: The agreement does not outline specific performance metrics for third-party arrangements. It is crucial to establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of third-party arrangements, such as uptime, response times, or customer satisfaction.

**Reporting Requirements to Senior Management**: The agreement does not require regular reporting to senior management on third-party arrangements. It is essential to establish a reporting framework to ensure that senior management is informed of any issues or concerns related to third-party arrangements.

To address these gaps, I recommend adding structured monitoring requirements with specific timelines and metrics. This could include:

* Regular review schedule: quarterly or bi-annually
* Performance metrics: uptime, response times, customer satisfaction, etc.
* Reporting requirements: quarterly or bi-annual reports to senior management
* Timelines: establish specific deadlines for completing reviews and reporting

By implementing these structured monitoring requirements, Atlassian can ensure that its third-party arrangements are operating effectively and in compliance with the agreement, ultimately reducing the risk of non-compliance and reputational damage."
"Search for documented escalation paths for unresolved third-party risks. Look for:
 • Clear escalation triggers
 • Escalation levels
 • Time frames for escalation
 • Resolution requirements
 • Board notification procedures

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding comprehensive escalation framework with specific triggers and procedures.","As a compliance officer, I have reviewed the Atlassian Customer Agreement and identified the need for a comprehensive escalation framework to address unresolved third-party risks. Upon reviewing the document, I found that there is no clear escalation path for resolving third-party risks, which could lead to potential security breaches or other adverse consequences.

To address this gap, I recommend that Atlassian establish a documented escalation framework that includes clear triggers, escalation levels, time frames, resolution requirements, and board notification procedures. This framework should be aligned with industry best practices and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA.

Specifically, the escalation framework should include:

1. Clear escalation triggers: Define specific scenarios that trigger the escalation process, such as receipt of a security alert, report of a vulnerability, or breach of a third-party contract.

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Suggest implementing structured risk analysis framework with clear assessment criteria.","Compliance Review: Risk Assessment Provisions

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there is a lack of explicit provisions detailing how risks arising from contractual arrangements are assessed. This is a critical oversight, as it leaves the parties vulnerable to unforeseen risks and potential disputes.

Risk Identification Methodologies: The Agreement does not provide any specific methodologies for identifying risks associated with the contractual arrangements. However, it does mention that Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet its requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use (Section 6.2). This suggests that Customer should be taking a proactive approach to identifying potential risks, but it does not provide a structured framework for doing so.

Assessment Criteria: The Agreement does not specify any clear assessment criteria for evaluating risks. This makes it difficult to determine how risks will be evaluated and prioritized. Section 14.1 (Damages Waiver) does mention that neither party will have any liability arising out of or related to this Agreement for any loss of use, lost data, lost profits, interruption of business or any indirect, special, incidental, reliance or consequential damages of any kind, except for Excluded Claims or Special Claims. However, this does not provide a clear framework for assessing risks.

Specifically, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but it does not provide clear function definitions, criticality criteria, impact assessments, or dependencies mapping.

This gap is critical because it leaves uncertainty about the extent to which critical functions are being outsourced and the potential risks associated with these arrangements. Without clear documentation, it is challenging to assess the impact of subcontractor failures or changes on the overall agreement and the customer's business.

To address this gap, I recommend that Atlassian adds detailed documentation of critical and important functions, including:

1. Clear function definitions: A detailed description of the specific functions being outsourced, including the scope of work, deliverables, and performance metrics.
2. Criticality criteria: A clear explanation of the criteria used to determine which functions are critical and important, including the potential impact of failure or delay.
3. Impact assessments: A thorough analysis of the potential impact of subcontractor failures or changes on the overall agreement and the customer's business.
