"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract does not explicitly address the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider.

Upon reviewing the contract, I found no clauses that discuss the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. The contract does mention the Customer's responsibility to determine whether the Products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use (Section 6.2), but it does not provide any guidance on assessing the substitutability of the provider.

**Gap Identification:** The absence of provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider is a gap in the contract. This gap may lead to difficulties in evaluating the risks associated with relying on a single provider and may hinder the ability to switch to an alternative provider if needed.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider. This can be achieved by defining criteria for determining substitutability, such as:

* The provider's ability to meet the Customer's specific requirements
* The provider's technical capabilities and infrastructure
* The provider's reputation, reliability, and security measures
* The provider's ability to provide timely and effective support and maintenance
* The provider's pricing and contract terms

By including such provisions, the contract can ensure that the Customer has a clear understanding of the provider's substitutability and can make informed decisions about their reliance on the provider."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","The contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. However, it does mention that Customer may increase its Scope of Use by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order, and that Atlassian will charge Customer for any increased Scope of Use at Atlassian's then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term. This suggests that substitutability may be assessed based on the technical specifications and operational complexity of the Products.

To provide clearer guidance, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

* Technical specifications: compatibility with existing infrastructure, software, and hardware
* Operational complexity: ease of integration, migration, and maintenance
* Cost: total cost of ownership, including upfront costs, ongoing expenses, and potential savings
* Ease of transition: time required to transition to the new Product, including training and support needs

Industry standards for substitutability assessments may include:

* The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9126-1 standard for software quality
* The ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) framework for IT service management
* The Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

By incorporating these criteria and industry standards, the contract can provide a more comprehensive framework for assessing substitutability and ensuring a smooth transition for Customer."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","**Compliance Finding:** The contract does not explicitly require documentation of alternative providers in the market, nor does it mandate regular market scans to identify and document such alternatives.

**Specific Clause:** Section 7.2 of the contract mentions that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products""). However, it does not require Customer to document or maintain a list of alternative providers.

**Missing Documentation Requirements:** To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry best practices, it is recommended to include a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This would help Customer to:

* Identify potential risks and opportunities associated with using third-party products
* Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, such as data protection and security standards
* Maintain a list of approved and vetted third-party providers
* Regularly review and update the list of alternative providers to reflect changes in the market

**Recommended Clause:** Consider adding the following clause to the contract:

""Customer shall maintain a list of alternative providers in the market, which shall be updated at least quarterly. The list shall include, but not be limited to, the following information:

* Name and contact details of the provider
* Description of the product or service offered
* Pricing and terms of service
* Security and data protection measures in place
* Compliance with regulatory requirements

Customer shall provide Atlassian with access to the list of alternative providers upon request."""
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers, which is a critical aspect of maintaining strategic flexibility and ensuring optimal use of resources.

Upon reviewing the agreement, I did not find any provisions that explicitly require a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. This is concerning, as such analyses are essential for evaluating the financial, operational, and strategic implications of using Atlassian's products and services.

**Recommendation:** To address this compliance gap, I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility. This can be achieved by incorporating a clause that requires Atlassian to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers on a periodic basis (e.g., annually or bi-annually). The analysis should consider financial, operational, and strategic factors, including:

* Financial implications: costs, pricing, and return on investment
* Operational implications: integration, scalability, and compatibility
* Strategic implications: alignment with business objectives, risk management, and innovation

By incorporating this requirement, Atlassian can ensure that its customers are able to make informed decisions about their use of Atlassian's products and services, and that they are able to adapt to changing business needs and market conditions."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require customers to maintain awareness of market alternatives or conduct periodic market research.

**Extracted Provisions:** There are no provisions in the Atlassian Customer Agreement that specifically mention the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives or conduct periodic market research.

**Validation:** The agreement focuses on the terms and conditions of the Atlassian products and services, including usage, support, and payment terms. However, it does not address the customer's responsibility to stay informed about market alternatives or emerging technologies.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend adding a provision that encourages customers to maintain awareness of market alternatives and emerging technologies. This could be achieved by including a clause that:

* Requires customers to conduct periodic market research to evaluate emerging alternatives
* Encourages customers to stay informed about market trends and developments
* Specifies the frequency and scope of market research, such as quarterly or annual reviews

Example of a proposed provision:

""Customer acknowledges that Atlassian is not obligated to provide exclusive or proprietary solutions, and Customer agrees to maintain awareness of market alternatives and emerging technologies. Customer shall conduct periodic market research to evaluate emerging alternatives and stay informed about market trends and developments. Customer shall provide Atlassian with written notice of any significant changes in the market or emergence of new technologies that may impact the use of Atlassian's products and services.""

This provision would help ensure that customers are aware of market alternatives and emerging technologies, allowing them to make informed decisions about their use of Atlassian's products and services."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","**Compliance Requirement:** The contract requires Customer to assess existing arrangements with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements, prior to entering into a new agreement.

**Specific Provisions:**

* Section 5.2 of the contract states that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.
* Section 5.2 also requires Customer to promptly confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use upon Atlassian's written request.
* Section 20.11 of the contract states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement.

**Gaps:**

* There is no requirement for Customer to conduct a comprehensive review of all existing contracts with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements.
* The contract does not specify the frequency or timing of such assessments, leaving it to Atlassian's discretion to initiate audits or reviews.
* The contract does not require Customer to provide Atlassian with access to all existing contracts or arrangements, which may limit Atlassian's ability to assess compliance.

**Recommendation:**

* Include a provision in the contract that requires Customer to conduct periodic reviews of all existing contracts with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements.
* Specify the frequency and timing of such reviews, such as annually or bi-annually.
* Require Customer to provide Atlassian with access to all existing contracts or arrangements to facilitate compliance assessments."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract does not explicitly require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers, such as third-party vendors, subcontractors, or affiliates.

**Documentation Review:** Upon reviewing the contract, I did not find any provisions that specifically require the identification and documentation of relationships with closely connected providers. Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations, but it does not require Customer to assess or document these relationships.

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards, I suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers in the contract. This could involve:

* Requiring Customer to identify and document all closely connected providers, including third-party vendors, subcontractors, and affiliates.
* Specifying the types of information that must be collected and documented, such as provider names, contact details, and risk assessment results.
* Establishing a process for regularly reviewing and updating the list of connected providers to ensure accuracy and compliance.
* Requiring Customer to assess and mitigate any risks associated with connected providers, such as data breaches, intellectual property infringement, or reputational damage.

By incorporating these requirements, the contract can better ensure that Customer is aware of and manages the risks associated with its relationships with closely connected providers."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","After reviewing the contract, I have identified the following clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services:

* Section 20.13 ""Export Restrictions"" mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, which implies that the customer should be aware of the potential risks associated with relying on a single provider for multiple services.
* Section 20.14 ""Government End-Users"" requires the customer to comply with the Government Amendment, which may involve evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services.

However, I did not find any explicit clause that requires tracking dependency on the provider. Therefore, I recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks, such as:

* Section 5.1 ""Concentration Risk Assessment"": The customer acknowledges that relying on a single provider for multiple services may pose concentration risks. The customer agrees to conduct a regular assessment of its dependency on the provider and to take steps to mitigate any identified risks.

This recommended section would ensure that the customer is aware of the potential risks associated with relying on a single provider and takes proactive steps to manage those risks."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","**Compliance Assessment: Interdependencies between Third-Party Services**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that assesses interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider.

**Provision:** Section 7.2, ""Third-Party Products""

This section states that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products""). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products, Atlassian will permit on Customer's behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product.

**Interdependency Assessment:** While this provision acknowledges the potential for interdependencies between third-party services, it does not explicitly assess how these interdependencies might amplify operational risks. To address this gap, I recommend requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might impact operational risks, such as:

* Data breaches or unauthorized access
* Service disruptions or outages
* Compliance risks or regulatory non-compliance
* Financial losses or reputational damage

By conducting this assessment, Atlassian can better understand the potential risks associated with third-party services and take steps to mitigate them, ensuring a more secure and reliable experience for its customers."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to market share and concentration risk:

* Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, but it does not specifically address market share or concentration risk.
* Section 20.14 (Government End-Users) mentions that the Agreement is subject to the Government Amendment, which may address certain risks related to government contracts, but it does not specifically address market share or concentration risk.
* Section 20.15 (No Contingencies) states that the Products, Support, and Advisory Services are purchased separately and not contingent on purchase or use of other Atlassian products and services, which may suggest that Atlassian does not have a dominant market position.

However, I did not find any explicit clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk, such as monopoly risks or limited alternatives. Therefore, I recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.

**Gap:** The Agreement does not include any provisions that require Atlassian to disclose its market share, concentration risk, or potential monopoly risks. This gap may leave customers vulnerable to potential risks associated with a dominant provider.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding clauses that require Atlassian to:

* Disclose its market share and concentration risk
* Provide information about potential monopoly risks or limited alternatives
* Implement measures to mitigate concentration risk, such as providing multiple suppliers or ensuring that critical components are not dependent on a single provider

By addressing these gaps, customers can better evaluate the risks associated with Atlassian's market dominance and make more informed decisions about their use of the Products."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","Compliance Assessment: Geographical Concentration Risks

The contract does not explicitly address geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. However, it does mention that the agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of the State of California if the customer is domiciled elsewhere. This suggests that the provider may have operations in these regions, but it does not provide any information about the specific risks associated with these locations.

Upon further review, the contract does not address location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters. The contract's focus is on the provider's obligations and responsibilities, rather than on the risks associated with its operations.

Recommendation: To mitigate geographical concentration risks, it is recommended that the contract include a geographical risk assessment that addresses location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability, natural disasters, and other regional risks. This assessment should be conducted by the provider and should be included in the contract as a condition of service."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","**Compliance Statement:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to ensure the protection of personal data.

**Extracted Provisions:**

1. Section 4.2 (Security Program): ""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures.""
2. Section 4.2 (Security Program) continues: ""Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.""
3. Section 4.2 (Security Program) further states: ""Further information about Atlassian’s security program is available on the Atlassian Trust Center at https://www.atlassian.com/trust, as updated from time to time.""
4. Section 6.3 (Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA): ""Unless the parties have entered into a ‘Business Associate Agreement,’ Customer must not (and must not permit anyone else to) upload to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to process) any patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.""

**Validation:**

These provisions demonstrate Atlassian's commitment to protecting personal data and ensuring compliance with EU data protection regulations, specifically the GDPR. The Security Program and compliance program are designed to protect Customer Data, and the provision of information on the Atlassian Trust Center suggests transparency and accountability.

However, to ensure complete compliance with EU data protection regulations, it is recommended to include a specific clause requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules, such as:

**Suggested Provision:**

""Third-country providers must comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any other applicable EU data protection regulations, including the principles of data protection by design and by default, data minimization, and transparency. They must also ensure that their data processing activities are subject to regular audits and certifications, and that they maintain a data protection officer responsible for ensuring compliance with EU data protection regulations.""

**Flagged Absence:**

The absence of a specific clause requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules, such as the GDPR, may raise concerns about the protection of personal data. To ensure complete compliance, it is recommended to include a specific clause addressing this requirement."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Compliance Assessment: The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, specifically in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance. However, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) outlines the governing law and jurisdiction for disputes arising from the Agreement, which may indirectly impact the effectiveness of law enforcement. To enhance compliance, it is recommended that Atlassian consider adding specific provisions to assess legal risks in their country, such as:

* A clause requiring the provider to maintain a robust compliance program, including regular audits and risk assessments, to ensure adherence to local laws and regulations.
* A provision outlining the provider's obligations to cooperate with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies in their jurisdiction.
* A clause specifying the provider's liability for any non-compliance with local laws and regulations, including any resulting fines or penalties.
* A provision requiring the provider to maintain adequate insurance coverage to mitigate potential risks and liabilities arising from non-compliance.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can demonstrate a commitment to compliance and regulatory risk management, which can help to mitigate potential risks and ensure the effectiveness of law enforcement in their jurisdiction."
"Search for clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. Extract these terms for verification.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions:

* Section 4.1: ""Customer Data. Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.""
* Section 4.2: ""Security Program. Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures.""
* Section 4.5: ""Removals and Suspension. Atlassian has no obligation to monitor Customer Data. Nonetheless, if Atlassian becomes aware that: (a) Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others (including relating to a takedown request received following the guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations), or (b) Customer’s use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may: (i) limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or (ii) suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the relevant Cloud Products.""

These clauses suggest that Atlassian may process Customer Data in various jurisdictions, but do not explicitly address data localization requirements. However, Section 4.2 implies that Atlassian has implemented measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, which may be relevant to data localization requirements.

**Recommendation**

To align with regulatory and operational needs, I suggest adding data localization provisions to the agreement, such as:

* Specifying the jurisdictions where Customer Data will be processed and stored
* Identifying the measures in place to ensure data localization compliance
* Defining the procedures for data transfer and storage in third-country jurisdictions
* Establishing clear guidelines for data localization and transfer in accordance with applicable laws and regulations

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure compliance with data localization requirements and mitigate associated risks in third-country jurisdictions."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Compliance Assessment: Country-Specific Operational Risks

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there are no provisions assessing country-specific operational risks, such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues. This is a significant gap in the contract, as it may expose Atlassian and its customers to unforeseen risks and liabilities.

The contract does not include any clauses that require Atlassian to evaluate or mitigate country-specific risks, nor does it provide any guidance on how customers should address such risks. This omission may lead to difficulties in managing and mitigating risks associated with operating in certain countries or regions.

To address this gap, I recommend adding a provision to the contract that requires Atlassian to conduct a risk assessment of country-specific operational risks. This assessment should consider factors such as:

* Political stability and potential for conflict
* Legal framework and regulatory requirements
* Infrastructure and logistics capabilities
* Economic and financial stability
* Environmental and social considerations

By incorporating such a provision, Atlassian can ensure that it is aware of and prepared to manage country-specific operational risks, and that customers are also informed and equipped to navigate these risks. This will help to mitigate potential liabilities and ensure a more stable and secure operating environment."

However, this provision does not specifically address critical risk assessments.

**Validation:** The contract does not contain any provisions that mandate periodic critical risk assessments of the ICT third-party provider. While Atlassian has a security program in place, as described in Section 4.2, there is no requirement for regular assessments of critical risks associated with the third-party provider.

**Recommendation:** To maintain operational resilience, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments of the ICT third-party provider. This could be achieved by inserting a new provision, such as:

""5.3 Critical Risk Assessments: Atlassian and Customer shall jointly conduct a critical risk assessment of the ICT third-party provider at least annually, or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The assessment shall identify and mitigate any critical risks associated with the third-party provider that could impact the security, availability, or integrity of the Products.""

This provision would ensure that both parties are aware of and addressing critical risks associated with the third-party provider, thereby maintaining operational resilience."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).

The contract does mention that Atlassian will maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures. However, this provision does not constitute a specific risk mitigation measure, but rather a general statement of Atlassian's commitment to security.

To address this gap, I recommend adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. For example, the contract could include provisions for:

* Contingency planning for critical system failures or data breaches
* Redundancy measures for critical systems or data
* Alternative provider arrangements for critical services
* Regular risk assessments and updates to mitigation measures

By including these provisions, the contract can provide a more comprehensive framework for risk management and ensure that both parties are aware of their responsibilities and obligations in the event of a critical risk scenario."
"Search for requirements to establish a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider’s performance and operations. Verify if the contract specifies monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements.

However, Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This implies that Atlassian has some level of monitoring and security measures in place, but it does not provide specific details on the tools, frequency, or reporting requirements.

To ensure compliance with this requirement, it is recommended that the contract be modified to include provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics such as service availability, response times, and other relevant performance indicators. This will enable the customer to have a clear understanding of the provider's performance and operations and to take corrective action if necessary."

* Section 5.2: License Verification - Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.
* Section 20.10: Force Majeure - Neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) due to events beyond its reasonable control and occurring without that party's fault or negligence.

However, these clauses do not explicitly require dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals. To address this, I suggest adding a requirement for regular risk reassessments, such as:

* Section 5.2: License Verification - Atlassian or its authorized agents may conduct regular audits of Customer's use of the Software Products, at least once every six (6) months, to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use and identify any potential risks or changes in market conditions.
* Section 20.10: Force Majeure - Both parties agree to conduct regular risk assessments, at least annually, to identify potential risks and changes in market conditions that may impact their obligations under this Agreement.

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the assessment of technological lock-in risks, which is a critical consideration for customers to ensure they can switch providers if needed.

**Extracted Clauses:**

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not ""reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Products."" This clause may be seen as limiting the ability to assess and mitigate technological lock-in risks.
* Section 5.1 (Modifications) allows Atlassian to provide source code for Customer to use internally to create bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications of the Software Products. However, it also requires Customer to keep the source code secure and confidential, which may limit the ability to assess and mitigate technological lock-in risks.
* Section 5.2 (License Verification) allows Atlassian to audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. While this clause is intended to prevent unauthorized use, it may also be seen as limiting the ability to assess and mitigate technological lock-in risks.

**Recommendation:** To address the risk of technological lock-in, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies. This could include:

* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide a clear and transparent assessment of the risks of technological lock-in, including the potential difficulties of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies.
* A clause that specifies potential exit strategies for customers, such as the ability to transfer licenses or data to a new provider, or the provision of open-source alternatives.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide regular updates on the status of its proprietary technologies and long-term dependencies, to enable customers to make informed decisions about their use of the Products."

Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies.","**Compliance Assessment: Proprietary Technology Dependencies**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses that assess proprietary technology dependencies, such as the use of custom software, unique configurations, or exclusive systems. Specifically, Section 5.1 (Modifications) of the Agreement addresses the use of source code and technical or performance information about the Products, which is considered Atlassian's Confidential Information. Additionally, Section 13 (Ownership) of the Agreement highlights the ownership of intellectual property and other rights in the Products, including any modifications or improvements.

However, I have not found explicit documentation or monitoring provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies. To address this gap, I recommend adding provisions to the Agreement that require Atlassian to:

1. Document all proprietary technologies used in the Products, including custom software, unique configurations, and exclusive systems.
2. Monitor and track dependencies on these proprietary technologies to ensure compliance with the Agreement.
3. Provide regular updates to Customer on any changes or updates to proprietary technologies used in the Products.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that Customer is aware of and understands the proprietary technology dependencies involved in the Products, and that these dependencies are properly documented and monitored to maintain compliance with the Agreement."

Atlassian will periodically assess the impact of technological changes on the substitutability of its services or systems and the risks to operational continuity. This assessment will be conducted at least annually and will include an evaluation of:

* The potential impact of updates, upgrades, and deprecations on the substitutability of Atlassian's services or systems
* The risks to operational continuity associated with these changes
* Any necessary adjustments to the agreement or support services to mitigate these risks

Atlassian will provide written notice to Customer of any significant changes or risks identified during this assessment and will work with Customer to develop a plan to address these issues.""

By including this clause, the agreement would require Atlassian to proactively evaluate the impact of technological changes on its services or systems and to take steps to mitigate any risks to operational continuity."

Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding requirements to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration.","**Compliance Assessment: Resource Concentration Risks**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses that require an assessment of resource concentration risks. Specifically, Section 2.3 (DPA) and Section 5.2 (License Verification) contain provisions that may be relevant to resource concentration risks.

**Extracted Provisions:**

1. **Section 2.3 (DPA)**: Atlassian may verify that Customer or an Affiliate owns or controls a domain specified for the Cloud Product's operation. This provision implies that Atlassian may assess the concentration of resources (in this case, domain ownership) to ensure compliance with the Agreement.
2. **Section 5.2 (License Verification)**: Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. This provision suggests that Atlassian may assess the concentration of resources (in this case, license usage) to ensure compliance with the Agreement.

**Validation:**

While these provisions do not explicitly mention resource concentration risks, they imply a need for Atlassian to assess and verify the concentration of resources (domain ownership and license usage) to ensure compliance with the Agreement. This is a reasonable interpretation, as resource concentration risks can arise from relying on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations.

**Recommendation:**

To address potential resource concentration risks, I suggest adding requirements to evaluate and address these risks. This could include:

* Conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential resource concentration risks
* Implementing measures to diversify resources (e.g., domain ownership, license usage) to mitigate concentration risks
* Developing procedures for verifying and validating resource concentration risks

By incorporating these requirements, Atlassian can better manage resource concentration risks and ensure compliance with the Agreement."

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions addressing resource constraints and their potential impact on service delivery. Specifically, Section 6.2 states that ""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use."" This provision implies that customers are responsible for assessing their own resource constraints and ensuring they have the necessary capacity to utilize the Products effectively.

However, I did not find explicit provisions requiring contingency plans for resource shortages or evaluating resource constraints. To address this gap, I recommend adding terms to the agreement that:

1. Require customers to assess their resource constraints and capacity limitations before using the Products.
2. Mandate the development of contingency plans to mitigate the impact of resource shortages on service delivery.

**Suggested Terms:**

* ""Customer must assess its resource constraints and capacity limitations before using the Products and ensure it has the necessary staff, equipment, and infrastructure to utilize the Products effectively.""
* ""Customer must develop and maintain contingency plans to mitigate the impact of resource shortages on service delivery, including but not limited to, identifying alternative resources, prioritizing tasks, and adjusting timelines as necessary.""

These suggested terms would enhance the agreement by promoting proactive resource planning and contingency management, ultimately ensuring that customers can utilize the Products effectively and efficiently."

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) requires Atlassian to have written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement, but it does not specify a regular frequency for reviewing or updating these agreements.

**Recommendation:**

To strengthen the compliance program, I recommend adding a term specifying periodic risk evaluations. This could be included in a new section, such as:

**Section 22. Risk Management**

* 22.1. Atlassian and Customer shall conduct regular critical risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with the Products and related Support and Advisory Services.
* 22.2. The risk assessments shall be conducted at least annually, or as otherwise specified in the applicable Order or Product-Specific Terms.
* 22.3. The risk assessments shall cover all aspects of the Products and related Support and Advisory Services, including but not limited to:
	+ Security risks
	+ Compliance risks
	+ Operational risks
	+ Financial risks
* 22.4. The results of the risk assessments shall be documented and maintained for a period of at least three (3) years.
* 22.5. Atlassian and Customer shall work together to implement any recommendations or mitigation strategies identified during the risk assessments.

This recommended term would ensure that both parties regularly evaluate and mitigate potential risks associated with the Products and related Support and Advisory Services, promoting a stronger compliance program."

Flag as a gap if no such measures are found.,"The contract includes specific mitigation measures for critical risks identified in assessments, particularly in Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) and Section 20.10 (Force Majeure). For instance, in Section 15, Atlassian agrees to defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. This demonstrates a proactive approach to mitigating risks associated with intellectual property infringement.

Additionally, Section 20.10 (Force Majeure) outlines that neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) due to events beyond its reasonable control and occurring without that party's fault or negligence. This provision acknowledges the existence of risks that may be outside of the parties' control and provides a framework for addressing them.

However, a gap is identified in Section 12.5 (Survival) where it is stated that these Sections survive expiration or termination of this Agreement, but there is no explicit mention of contingency plans or predefined responses to critical risks. This suggests that while the contract acknowledges the existence of risks, it does not provide a comprehensive framework for addressing them.

References to contingency plans or predefined responses are limited to Section 20.10 (Force Majeure), which provides a general framework for addressing events beyond the parties' control. However, this provision does not constitute a comprehensive contingency plan, and the contract does not provide explicit guidance on how to respond to critical risks."

5. Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement): Atlassian may modify this Agreement, including the Policies and Product-Specific Terms, without prior notice, which may lead to changes in the Scope of Use or fees.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Exit Strategy:** Consider adding a clause that allows Customer to exit the Agreement or a Subscription Term without penalty, subject to reasonable notice (e.g., 30 days).
2. **Scope of Use Flexibility:** Review the Scope of Use provisions to ensure they are flexible enough to accommodate changes in Customer's business needs.
3. **Fees Transparency:** Ensure that fees are transparent and clearly disclosed, including any potential increases or changes to the Scope of Use.
4. **Audit and Verification:** Consider limiting the frequency and scope of audits to ensure they do not become overly burdensome or restrictive.
5. **Contractual Exclusivity:** Review the Agreement to ensure that it does not contain any provisions that would prevent Customer from using competing products or services.

By addressing these concerns, Atlassian can help mitigate the risk of technological lock-in and provide Customer with more flexibility and control over their use of the Products."

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there is a lack of explicit clauses addressing shared resource risks, such as multi-tenancy in cloud environments. This is a critical compliance concern, as shared resource risks can impact the security, availability, and performance of the Products.

**Extracted References:**

* Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
* Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension) states that Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products, if Atlassian becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others.

**Validation:**

While these references provide some assurance regarding Atlassian's security measures and data protection, they do not explicitly address shared resource risks. The lack of clear clauses on this topic may lead to compliance gaps and potential risks for Customers.

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate shared resource risks, I suggest adding a requirement for dedicated resources or impact assessments to the Agreement. This could include:

* A clause specifying that Atlassian will provide dedicated resources for Customers with high-security or high-availability requirements.
* A requirement for Atlassian to conduct regular impact assessments to identify and mitigate potential shared resource risks.
* A provision for Customers to request dedicated resources or impact assessments, and for Atlassian to provide a clear response regarding their feasibility and costs.

To address this compliance requirement, I recommend adding a provision to the agreement that requires resilience testing of BCDR plans. This provision should specify the testing frequency and scope to ensure that Atlassian's BCDR plans are regularly tested and validated to ensure their effectiveness in the event of a disaster or outage.

Recommended Provision:

""Resilience Testing: Atlassian will conduct regular resilience testing of its BCDR plans to ensure their effectiveness in the event of a disaster or outage. The testing frequency and scope will be specified in the Documentation and will be reviewed and updated annually. Atlassian will provide Customer with a copy of the testing results and any recommendations for improvement.""

This provision will ensure that Atlassian's BCDR plans are regularly tested and validated, and that Customer is informed of the testing results and any recommendations for improvement."
Incident Reporting Timelines:Search for clauses specifying incident reporting timelines. Extract and confirm if timelines are aligned with regulatory standards. Flag gaps if timelines are not defined.,"**Compliance Observation:** Incident reporting timelines are a critical component of compliance with regulatory standards, and it is essential to ensure that these timelines are clearly defined and aligned with regulatory requirements.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to incident reporting timelines:

* Section 4.5: ""Removals and Suspension"" - Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products, if Atlassian becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others.
* Section 15.1: ""IP Indemnification"" - Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. However, there is no specific timeline for reporting incidents related to intellectual property infringement.

**Compliance Gap:** There is no clear incident reporting timeline specified in the Atlassian Customer Agreement. Regulatory standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), require timely incident reporting. The absence of a clear incident reporting timeline may lead to non-compliance with these regulations.

**Recommendation:** Atlassian should consider adding a clause to the Customer Agreement that specifies incident reporting timelines, including the timeframe for reporting incidents related to intellectual property infringement, data breaches, and other security incidents. This will help ensure compliance with regulatory standards and provide customers with clear expectations regarding incident reporting."
"Escalation Procedures:Search for provisions defining escalation procedures for incidents. Extract details of roles, responsibilities, and communication paths. If missing, suggest including an escalation matrix.","Compliance Review: Escalation Procedures are Critical for Timely Resolution of Incidents.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I did not find explicit provisions defining escalation procedures for incidents. However, Section 8 (Support and Advisory Services) mentions that Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies. It also states that Atlassian's provision of Support or Advisory Services is subject to Customer providing timely access to Customer Materials and personnel reasonably requested by Atlassian. This suggests that Atlassian has a support process in place, but it does not provide clear escalation procedures for incidents.

To ensure timely resolution of incidents, I recommend including an escalation matrix in the Agreement. The escalation matrix should outline the roles, responsibilities, and communication paths for escalating incidents, including the following:

* Clear definitions of incident severity levels (e.g., critical, major, minor)
* Designated escalation contacts for each severity level
* Communication protocols for escalating incidents, including notification timelines and channels (e.g., email, phone, ticketing system)
* Responsibilities for incident investigation, resolution, and follow-up
* Escalation procedures for incidents that require external support or third-party involvement

By including an escalation matrix, Atlassian can ensure that incidents are addressed promptly and efficiently, minimizing downtime and impact on Customer operations."
"Root Cause Analysis:Identify clauses requiring root cause analysis for incidents. Extract timelines and responsibilities, if present. Recommend including root cause analysis terms if absent.","Compliance Requirement: Root Cause Analysis for Incidents

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires root cause analysis for incidents, specifically in Section 12.5 (Survival), which states that the parties' obligations under this Agreement will survive expiration or termination, including the requirement for root cause analysis in the event of an incident. However, the Agreement does not explicitly outline the process for conducting root cause analysis or the responsibilities of the parties involved.

Recommendation: Include Root Cause Analysis Terms

To ensure compliance with this requirement, I recommend including the following terms in the Agreement:

* A clear definition of root cause analysis and its purpose
* The responsibilities of each party in conducting root cause analysis, including timelines for completion
* The process for identifying and addressing the root cause of an incident
* The procedures for documenting and reporting the results of the root cause analysis

Example of Recommended Terms:

""12.6 Root Cause Analysis

In the event of an incident, the parties will conduct a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the incident. The root cause analysis will be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:

* The affected party will notify the other party of the incident within [insert timeframe, e.g., 24 hours]
* The parties will jointly conduct a root cause analysis within [insert timeframe, e.g., 7 days]
* The root cause analysis will be documented and reported to the other party within [insert timeframe, e.g., 14 days]
* The parties will work together to address the root cause of the incident and implement corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future""

Corrective Actions:Search for provisions mandating corrective actions based on root cause findings. Extract details on timelines and scope. Flag gaps if corrective action requirements are missing.,"**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly mandate corrective actions based on root cause findings, creating a gap in compliance requirements.

**Corrective Action Requirements:** Upon reviewing the agreement, I did not find any provisions that require Atlassian to take corrective actions based on root cause findings. This is a critical compliance requirement, as it ensures that the organization takes proactive steps to address and mitigate risks and issues identified through root cause analysis.

**Timeline and Scope:** The agreement does not specify a timeline for corrective actions or the scope of activities that must be addressed. This lack of clarity creates uncertainty and may lead to inconsistent application of corrective actions.

**Gaps in Compliance Requirements:** The absence of corrective action requirements creates a gap in compliance requirements, which may lead to:

* Inadequate risk management and mitigation
* Inconsistent application of corrective actions
* Failure to address root causes of issues and risks
* Non-compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards

**Recommendation:** To address this compliance gap, I recommend that Atlassian incorporate provisions that mandate corrective actions based on root cause findings, including:

* A clear definition of corrective actions and their scope
* A specified timeline for implementing corrective actions
* Requirements for root cause analysis and identification of corrective actions
* Procedures for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of corrective actions

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that corrective actions are taken in a timely and effective manner, reducing the risk of non-compliance and improving overall compliance posture."

**Validation:**

* The clause allows Atlassian to use subcontractors or Affiliates, but it does not specify any restrictions on the types of subcontracted services, geographical locations, or critical functions.
* The clause emphasizes Atlassian's responsibility for its overall performance and for having written agreements with subcontractors, which is a positive aspect.

**Recommendation:**

To provide clear boundaries for subcontracting, particularly for critical or important functions, I recommend including additional terms that specify:

* Types of subcontracted services: Clearly define which services can be subcontracted and which cannot.
* Geographical locations: Specify the geographical locations where subcontractors can operate.
* Critical functions: Identify critical functions that cannot be subcontracted or require special approval.

**Proposed Additional Terms:**

* Atlassian may subcontract only the following services: [list specific services, e.g., data processing, software development, etc.].

However, the contract does not specify the approval process, including criteria and timelines, for the financial entity's prior written approval. This gap raises concerns about the financial entity's ability to ensure that subcontractors meet the required standards and comply with the agreement.

**Gap:** The contract lacks a clear clause mandating prior approval from the financial entity before engaging subcontractors. This omission creates uncertainty and potential risks for the financial entity.

**Suggested Addition:** To address this gap, I recommend adding the following clause:

""20.11.1. Prior Approval for Subcontractors. Atlassian must obtain prior written approval from [Financial Entity] before engaging any subcontractor to perform any obligations under this Agreement. The approval process will include:

* A written request from Atlassian to [Financial Entity] at least [X] days prior to engaging the subcontractor
* Provision of detailed information about the subcontractor, including their qualifications, experience, and relevant certifications
* Review and approval by [Financial Entity] of the subcontractor's terms and conditions
* A written agreement between Atlassian and the subcontractor that meets the requirements of this Agreement
