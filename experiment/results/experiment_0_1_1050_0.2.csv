"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I found that there is no explicit mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. This is a gap in the contract.

However, I did find a clause that addresses the customer's responsibility to determine whether the products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use (Section 6.2: Product Assessment). This clause implies that the customer has a responsibility to assess the suitability of the products, but it does not specifically address the substitutability of the provider.

To address this gap, I recommend that the contract include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider. This could involve defining criteria for determining substitutability, such as:

* The provider's ability to meet the customer's specific requirements
* The provider's level of integration with the customer's existing systems and processes
* The provider's reputation and track record for reliability and security
* The provider's ability to adapt to changing customer needs and requirements
* The provider's level of control and influence over the provision of the services

By including such provisions, the contract can provide a clear framework for assessing the substitutability of the provider and ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the provider's capabilities and limitations."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","The contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. However, it does mention that Atlassian may verify that the customer owns or controls the domain specified for the Cloud Product's operation, which implies a level of technical compatibility. Additionally, the contract mentions that Atlassian may audit the customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use, which suggests a level of operational complexity.

To provide clarity and ensure compliance, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

* Technical specifications: Define the minimum technical requirements for substitutability, including hardware, software, and network compatibility.
* Cost: Establish a clear cost framework for substitutability, including the costs associated with transitioning to a new product or service.
* Ease of transition: Develop a set of metrics to measure the ease of transition, including the time required to complete the transition, the number of personnel required, and the level of training needed.
* Operational complexity: Define the operational complexity criteria, including the level of integration with other systems, the level of customization required, and the level of support needed.

Industry standards for substitutability assessments include:

* The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 standard for information security management systems
* The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for secure payment processing
* The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework for managing and reducing cybersecurity risk

By incorporating these criteria and industry standards, the contract can provide a clear and measurable framework for determining substitutability, ensuring compliance and reducing the risk of non-compliance."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","**Compliance Finding:** The contract does not explicitly require documentation of alternative providers in the market, nor does it mandate regular market scans to identify and document such alternatives.

**Specific Clause:** Section 7.2 of the contract mentions that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products""). However, it does not require Customer to document or maintain a list of alternative providers.

**Missing Documentation Requirements:** To ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks, I recommend including a clause that mandates regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This would help Customer maintain a list of viable alternatives and ensure that they are aware of any changes in the market.

**Recommended Clause:** ""Customer shall maintain a list of alternative providers in the market, which shall be updated at least quarterly. The list shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: (i) provider name, (ii) product/service offerings, (iii) pricing, and (iv) contact information. Customer shall provide Atlassian with access to this list upon request.""

**Follow-up:** I recommend including this clause in the contract to ensure that Customer maintains a list of alternative providers and is aware of any changes in the market. This would help mitigate potential risks and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers, which is a critical aspect of maintaining strategic flexibility and ensuring optimal resource allocation.

Upon reviewing the agreement, I did not find any specific requirements for conducting cost-benefit analyses of alternative providers. The agreement does mention that Customer may terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term upon notice for any reason (Section 12.2), but it does not explicitly require a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers before making such decisions.

To address this gap, I recommend adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility. This could involve:

* Requiring Customer to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers at regular intervals (e.g., annually or bi-annually) to assess the optimal resource allocation and ensure alignment with business objectives.
* Specifying that the analysis should consider financial, operational, and strategic factors, including but not limited to:
	+ Financial factors: costs, pricing, and revenue implications
	+ Operational factors: integration, scalability, and reliability
	+ Strategic factors: alignment with business objectives, innovation, and competitiveness

By incorporating these requirements, the agreement can ensure that Customer maintains a strategic and flexible approach to resource allocation, ultimately benefiting from optimal use of resources and alignment with business objectives."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks explicit provisions requiring the customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives, which is a crucial aspect of compliance with market competition laws.

**Extracted Provision:** There is no specific clause in the agreement that requires the customer to conduct periodic market research or maintain awareness of market alternatives.

**Validation:** The absence of such provisions is a gap in the agreement, which may expose Atlassian to potential compliance risks. Market competition laws, such as the Sherman Act in the United States, require businesses to maintain a competitive market and not engage in anti-competitive practices.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend adding provisions to the agreement that require the customer to:

1. Conduct periodic market research to evaluate emerging alternatives and market trends.
2. Maintain awareness of market alternatives and competitors.
3. Report any changes in the market or emergence of new competitors to Atlassian.

This will help ensure that the customer remains compliant with market competition laws and that Atlassian is aware of any potential risks or opportunities in the market.

**Proposed Provision:**

""Customer shall conduct periodic market research to evaluate emerging alternatives and market trends, and shall maintain awareness of market alternatives and competitors. Customer shall report any changes in the market or emergence of new competitors to Atlassian within [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days].""

This provision will help ensure that the customer remains compliant with market competition laws and that Atlassian is aware of any potential risks or opportunities in the market."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","**Compliance Requirement:** The contract requires periodic reviews of existing contracts with the provider to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the new agreement.

**Assessment Requirements:** Section 5.2 of the contract states that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. This includes verifying the number, type, and scope of existing arrangements with Atlassian. Specifically, the contract requires Customer to:

* Confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use upon Atlassian's written request (Section 5.2).
* Ensure that all existing arrangements with Atlassian are reviewed and updated to reflect the terms and conditions of the new agreement.

**Gaps:** The contract does not explicitly require a comprehensive assessment of existing arrangements with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. However, the audit provision in Section 5.2 implies that Atlassian may conduct periodic reviews to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement.

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance with the contract, it is recommended that Customer includes periodic reviews of all existing contracts with Atlassian in their compliance program. This should include:

* Conducting a comprehensive assessment of existing arrangements with Atlassian to identify any gaps or inconsistencies with the new agreement.
* Reviewing and updating existing contracts to reflect the terms and conditions of the new agreement.
* Scheduling regular audits with Atlassian to ensure ongoing compliance with the agreement.

By implementing these measures, Customer can ensure that their existing arrangements with Atlassian are compliant with the new agreement and minimize the risk of non-compliance."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract does not explicitly require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers, such as third-party vendors or suppliers, which may pose risks to the customer's data or business operations.

**Recommendation:** To address this compliance gap, I suggest adding a provision to the contract that requires the customer to evaluate and document relationships with closely connected providers. This can be achieved by including a clause that requires the customer to:

* Identify and document all closely connected providers that may have access to customer data or business operations
* Assess the risks associated with these relationships, including potential data breaches, security vulnerabilities, or business disruptions
* Develop and implement procedures to mitigate these risks, such as conducting regular security audits, implementing data encryption, or establishing incident response plans

**Example Provision:**

""Customer shall identify and document all closely connected providers that may have access to Customer Data or business operations. Customer shall assess the risks associated with these relationships and develop procedures to mitigate these risks. Customer shall provide Atlassian with written notice of any changes to these relationships or risk assessments, and shall cooperate with Atlassian to ensure compliance with this Agreement.""

By including this provision, the contract can ensure that the customer takes a proactive approach to managing risks associated with closely connected providers, and that Atlassian is informed of any changes to these relationships."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract does not explicitly mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services.

Upon reviewing the contract, I did not find any clauses that specifically require tracking dependency on the provider or evaluating concentration risks. However, Section 20.13 ""Export Restrictions"" mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, which implies that the customer must comply with applicable laws and regulations.

**Recommendation:** To address potential concentration risks, I suggest adding a section to the contract that requires the customer to:

* Identify and assess the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services
* Track and monitor the dependency on the provider
* Develop a plan to mitigate or manage concentration risks, if identified

This section can be added to the contract under a new clause, such as ""Concentration Risk Management"" or ""Dependency Tracking""."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","**Compliance Assessment: Interdependencies between Third-Party Services**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that assesses interdependencies between services provided by third-party providers.

**Extracted Clause:**

7.2. Third-Party Products. Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.

**Interdependency Assessment:**

While the agreement does not explicitly require an assessment of interdependencies between third-party services, it does acknowledge that use of Third-Party Products with Atlassian Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider. This suggests that Atlassian may have some level of control over the interdependencies between its services and those of third-party providers. However, the agreement does not provide any guidance on how to assess or mitigate operational risks associated with these interdependencies.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This could be achieved by adding a clause to the agreement that requires customers to:

* Identify and assess potential interdependencies between third-party services and Atlassian Products
* Evaluate the potential operational risks associated with these interdependencies
* Develop a plan to mitigate or manage these risks

This would help ensure that customers are aware of the potential risks associated with using third-party services with Atlassian Products and can take steps to mitigate them."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to market share and concentration risk:

* Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, but it does not specifically address market share or concentration risk.
* Section 20.14 (Government End-Users) mentions that the Agreement is subject to the Government Amendment, which may address certain aspects of market share and concentration risk, but it is not explicitly stated.
* Section 20.15 (No Contingencies) states that the Products, Support, and Advisory Services are purchased separately and not contingent on purchase or use of other Atlassian products and services, which may imply a lack of dependence on a single provider. However, this clause does not directly address market share or concentration risk.

However, I did not find any clauses that explicitly require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk, such as assessing monopoly risks or limited alternatives. Therefore, I recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.

**Gap:** The Agreement does not contain specific provisions to assess and mitigate the risks associated with Atlassian's market share and concentration, which may impact the customer's ability to switch providers or negotiate better terms.

**Recommendation:** Consider adding clauses that require Atlassian to:

* Provide information about its market share and concentration risk
* Assess and mitigate potential risks associated with its dominance in the market
* Ensure that customers have access to alternative providers or solutions
* Regularly review and update the Agreement to reflect changes in the market and Atlassian's market share

By incorporating these provisions, the Agreement can better address the risks associated with provider dominance and concentration, ensuring a more resilient and sustainable relationship between Atlassian and its customers."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","**Compliance Assessment: Geographical Concentration Risks**

The contract does not explicitly address geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. However, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) mentions that the agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of the State of California if the customer is domiciled elsewhere. This provision does not directly address geographical concentration risks, but it implies that the provider may have operations or data centers in these jurisdictions.

**Location-Specific Factors**

Upon reviewing the contract, I did not find any specific provisions addressing risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters. The contract does mention that the provider may use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the agreement (Section 20.11), but it does not provide any information about the location of these subcontractors or affiliates.

**Recommendation**

To mitigate geographical concentration risks, I recommend including a geographical risk assessment in the contract. This assessment should consider the provider's operations, data centers, and subcontractors' locations to identify potential risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability, natural disasters, and regulatory compliance. The assessment should also consider the provider's business continuity and disaster recovery plans to ensure that they are adequate to address potential risks."

3. Section 4.5: ""Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the relevant Cloud Products. Atlassian may also take any such measures where required by Law, or at the request of a governmental authority."" This provision indicates that Atlassian will comply with EU data protection laws, including the GDPR, when processing and storing Customer Data.
4. Section 6.3: ""Unless the parties have entered into a ‘Business Associate Agreement,’ Customer must not (and must not permit anyone else to) upload to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to process) any patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act."" This provision highlights the importance of protecting sensitive health information, which is also a key aspect of GDPR compliance.

**Validation:**

These provisions demonstrate that Atlassian is committed to complying with EU data protection rules, including the GDPR. The agreement requires Atlassian to implement robust security measures, process Customer Data in accordance with EU data protection laws, and protect sensitive health information.

**Follow-up if Missing:**

Flag the absence of explicit provisions requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations. Suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations, such as:

* Section 4.1: ""Atlassian will process Customer Data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable EU data protection laws.""
* Section 4.2: ""Atlassian will implement and maintain an information security program that complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable EU data protection laws.""

These additions will ensure that third-country providers are held to the same standards as EU-based providers, providing an additional layer of protection for Customer Data."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Compliance Assessment: The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, particularly in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance. However, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) outlines the governing law and jurisdiction for disputes arising from the Agreement, which may indirectly impact the effectiveness of law enforcement. To enhance compliance, it is recommended that Atlassian consider adding specific provisions to assess legal risks in their country of operation, such as:

* A clause requiring Atlassian to maintain a robust compliance program, including regular risk assessments and audits, to ensure adherence to applicable laws and regulations.
* A provision outlining the procedures for handling and resolving disputes, including the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, to minimize the risk of litigation and ensure timely resolution.
* A requirement for Atlassian to maintain adequate insurance coverage to mitigate potential losses and damages arising from non-compliance or disputes.
* A clause specifying the provider's obligations to cooperate with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies in their jurisdiction, including providing access to relevant information and documentation.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can demonstrate a commitment to compliance and risk management, which can help to mitigate potential legal risks and ensure the effectiveness of law enforcement in their jurisdiction."

Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions:

* Section 4.1: ""Customer Data. Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement."" This clause implies that Atlassian may process Customer Data in various jurisdictions, including third-country jurisdictions.
* Section 4.2: ""Security Program. Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures."" This clause highlights Atlassian's security measures to protect Customer Data, but does not explicitly address data localization requirements.
* Section 4.5: ""Removals and Suspension. Atlassian has no obligation to monitor Customer Data. Nonetheless, if Atlassian becomes aware that: (a) Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others (including relating to a takedown request received following the guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations), or (b) Customer’s use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may: (i) limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or (ii) suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the relevant Cloud Products."" This clause implies that Atlassian may remove or suspend access to Customer Data in certain circumstances, but does not explicitly address data localization requirements.

**Recommendation**

Based on the review, I recommend adding data localization provisions to the agreement to align with regulatory and operational needs. This may include:

* Specifying the jurisdictions where Customer Data will be processed and stored
* Outlining the measures to be taken in case of data breaches or unauthorized access
* Defining the procedures for data transfer and storage in third-country jurisdictions
* Ensuring compliance with relevant data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to data localization and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","**Compliance Assessment: Country-Specific Operational Risks**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there are no provisions assessing country-specific operational risks, such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues. This is a significant gap in the contract, as it may expose Atlassian and its customers to unforeseen risks and liabilities.

**Gap in Contract:**

The contract does not require an evaluation of country-specific risks, which could lead to:

* Inadequate risk management and mitigation strategies
* Increased exposure to political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues
* Potential disruptions to business operations or delivery of products and services
* Unforeseen costs or liabilities resulting from country-specific risks

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I recommend adding a provision to the contract that requires an evaluation of country-specific operational risks. This could include:

* A requirement for customers to disclose their country of operation and any potential risks associated with it
* A provision for Atlassian to assess and mitigate country-specific risks, such as through due diligence or risk management strategies
* A clause that outlines the responsibilities and liabilities of both parties in the event of country-specific risks

By incorporating this provision, the contract can better address country-specific operational risks and ensure that both parties are aware of and prepared for potential risks and liabilities."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider. Confirm if these assessments are mandated on a defined schedule (e.g., quarterly or annually). Extract and validate the relevant provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.","**Compliance Finding:** The contract does not explicitly require regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider.

**Validation:** This provision only addresses audits to confirm compliance with the Scope of Use, not critical risk assessments. It does not mandate regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider.

**Recommendation:** To maintain operational resilience, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments, such as:

""5.3 Critical Risk Assessments: Atlassian and Customer shall jointly conduct critical risk assessments of the Software Products and related third-party providers at least annually, or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties. These assessments shall identify and mitigate potential risks to operational resilience, data security, and business continuity. The results of these assessments shall be documented and shared with both parties, and any necessary corrective actions shall be taken to address identified risks.""

This clause would ensure that both parties regularly assess and address critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider, maintaining operational resilience and compliance with relevant regulations."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","Upon reviewing the contract, I have identified that it does not explicitly specify risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. While the contract mentions that Atlassian will use ""reasonable efforts"" to ensure the security and operation of the Cloud Products, it does not provide specific measures for mitigating risks such as data breaches, system failures, or unauthorized access.

The contract does mention that Atlassian will maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, but this is not a direct mitigation measure for critical risks. Additionally, the contract does not provide any contingency plans or redundancies in case of a disaster or system failure.

To address this gap, I recommend adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. This could include:

* Contingency plans for data breaches, system failures, or unauthorized access
* Redundancies for critical systems or data storage
* Alternative providers for critical services
* Regular risk assessments and updates to mitigation measures

By incorporating these provisions, the contract can provide a more comprehensive framework for managing and mitigating critical risks, ensuring that both parties are aware of their responsibilities and obligations in case of a risk event."
"Search for requirements to establish a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider’s performance and operations. Verify if the contract specifies monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics (e.g., service availability, response times).","**Compliance Requirement:** The contract requires ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations to ensure compliance with the agreement.

**Verification:** Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there is no specific provision for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations. The contract does mention the need for Atlassian to maintain a security program (Section 4.2) and provide security measures (Section 4.2), but it does not specify any requirements for continuous monitoring or reporting.

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance with the agreement, it is recommended that the contract be amended to include provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics such as service availability, response times, and security incident reporting. This will enable the customer to track and address any potential risks or issues related to the provider's performance and operations in a timely manner."
"Look for clauses requiring regular reassessment of risks to account for changes in the provider’s operations, market conditions, or technological advancements. Extract and validate the terms.

**Validation:**

These terms indicate that Atlassian reserves the right to request a written confirmation from the customer regarding their compliance with the Scope of Use, and may conduct audits to verify compliance. However, the frequency of these audits is limited to once every 12 months, which may not be sufficient to account for rapid changes in the provider's operations, market conditions, or technological advancements.

**Recommendation:**

To enhance compliance and risk management, I suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals. This could be achieved by:

* Adding a clause that requires the customer to notify Atlassian of any significant changes to their operations, market conditions, or technological advancements that may impact their use of the Software Products.
* Specifying that Atlassian may conduct additional audits or risk assessments at its discretion, without being limited to the 12-month frequency.
* Requiring the customer to provide regular updates on their compliance with the Scope of Use, such as quarterly or bi-annual reports.

By incorporating these requirements, the agreement can better address the need for regular reassessment of risks and ensure that the customer's use of the Software Products remains compliant with the agreed-upon terms."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies.","**Compliance Assessment: Vendor Lock-in Risks**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the assessment of technological lock-in risks, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies. However, Section 5.2 (License Verification) and Section 10.1 (Fees) contain provisions that may be relevant to this issue.

**Relevant Clauses:**

* Section 5.2 (License Verification): Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. If Customer exceeds its Scope of Use, Atlassian may invoice for that excess use, and Customer will pay Atlassian promptly after invoice receipt.
* Section 10.1 (Fees): Fees are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. For any purchases Customer makes through a Reseller, any refunds from Atlassian payable to Customer relating to that purchase will be remitted by that Reseller, unless Atlassian specifically notifies Customer otherwise at the time of refund.

**Recommendation:**

To address the risks of vendor lock-in, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies. This could include:

* A provision requiring Atlassian to provide a clear and transparent assessment of the risks of vendor lock-in, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies.
* A provision specifying potential exit strategies, such as providing Customer with access to source code, data portability, or a clear process for transitioning to a new provider.
* A provision requiring Atlassian to provide regular updates on any changes to its technology or business practices that may impact Customer's ability to switch providers.

By including these provisions, the agreement can better protect Customer's interests and provide a clear understanding of the risks and potential exit strategies associated with vendor lock-in."

However, Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

**Measurability:** The security program clause is not clearly measurable, as it does not specify specific targets or metrics for RTOs and RPOs.

**Recommendation:** To ensure business continuity and data integrity, it is recommended that the agreement include specific clauses that outline RTOs and RPOs for critical services. This can be achieved by adding the following language to the agreement:

* ""Atlassian will ensure that all critical services have a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of [insert time frame, e.g., 2 hours] and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of [insert time frame, e.g., 1 hour] for all Customer Data.""

Additionally, Section 15.4 (Mitigation) outlines Atlassian's obligations to procure rights for continued use of the Products, replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminate the affected Subscription Term and refund pre-paid fees.

However, a gap in the agreement is noted in the absence of specific timelines and scope for corrective actions. While Section 12.3 provides a 30-day notice period for material breaches, it does not specify the timeframe for corrective actions to be taken.

This clause does not specify any limitations on types of subcontracted services, geographical locations, or critical functions. However, it does emphasize Atlassian's responsibility for its subcontractors' performance and the need for written agreements.

**Recommendation**

To ensure clear boundaries for subcontracting, particularly for critical or important functions, I recommend including the following terms:

* Specify the types of services that may be subcontracted, such as development, maintenance, or support services.
* Identify the geographical locations where subcontracting is permitted, such as specific countries or regions.
* Define critical functions that cannot be subcontracted, such as data processing or security-related services.
* Establish requirements for subcontractor selection, such as qualifications, experience, or certifications.
* Specify the level of control Atlassian will maintain over subcontractors, such as regular audits or performance reviews.

**Approval Process:** The contract does not specify the approval process, criteria, or timelines for obtaining prior written approval. It only mentions that Atlassian must have ""appropriate written agreements"" with its subcontractors, but it does not provide further details.

**Gap Analysis:** The lack of specificity in the approval process, criteria, and timelines creates a gap in the contract. This gap may lead to disputes or misunderstandings between the parties regarding the subcontracting process.

**Suggested Clause:** To address this gap, I recommend adding a clause that mandates prior approval for subcontracting, specifies the approval process, and includes criteria and timelines. Here is a suggested clause:

The current agreement does not explicitly require notification and evaluation clauses for changes in subcontracting chains. To address this, I recommend including the following terms:

**Notification Clause:**

Atlassian must notify Customer in writing within [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days] of any changes to its subcontracting chain, including the addition or removal of subcontractors. The notification must include the following details:

* Name and contact information of the new subcontractor
* Description of the services to be provided by the new subcontractor
* Reason for the change in subcontracting chain

**Risk Assessment Clause:**

Atlassian must conduct a risk assessment of any changes to its subcontracting chain, including the addition or removal of subcontractors. The risk assessment must consider the following factors:

* The subcontractor's experience and qualifications
* The subcontractor's compliance with relevant laws and regulations
* The subcontractor's security measures and data protection policies
* The subcontractor's financial stability and reputation

The risk assessment must be documented and provided to Customer upon request.

**Validation of Details:**

To validate the details of the subcontracting chain, Atlassian must provide Customer with the following information:

* A list of all subcontractors used by Atlassian, including their names, contact information, and descriptions of the services provided
* A copy of the subcontracting agreements between Atlassian and its subcontractors
* A description of the security measures and data protection policies implemented by Atlassian and its subcontractors

**Recommendation:**

To ensure compliance with this requirement, I recommend including the following clauses in the agreement:

* A notification clause that requires Atlassian to notify Customer of any changes to its subcontracting chain within a specified timeframe
* A risk assessment clause that requires Atlassian to conduct a risk assessment of any changes to its subcontracting chain
* A validation clause that requires Atlassian to provide Customer with detailed information about its subcontracting chain, including a list of subcontractors, subcontracting agreements, and security measures.

By including these clauses, Atlassian can ensure transparency and accountability in its subcontracting chain, and Customer can have confidence in the security and reliability of the services provided."
