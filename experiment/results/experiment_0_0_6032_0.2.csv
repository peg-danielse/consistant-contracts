Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","**Compliance Review: Financial Entity's Retained Responsibility for Financial Services Laws**

Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that Atlassian has made clear statements regarding its retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. The contract includes comprehensive coverage of various financial services laws, including tax laws, export restrictions, and government end-user requirements. Specifically, Section 20.2 (Compliance with Laws) states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business, and Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) requires Customer to comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products.

However, upon closer examination, it appears that there is a potential gap in the contract regarding the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. While the contract mentions compliance with Laws, it does not explicitly state that Atlassian retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. To address this, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the contract, such as:

**Recommended Addition:**

""20.16. Retention of Regulatory Responsibilities. Atlassian retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws and regulations, including but not limited to, anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, and sanctions regulations. Customer acknowledges that Atlassian is responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws and regulations, and Customer will not delegate or transfer any regulatory responsibilities to Atlassian.""

Follow-up if Missing: Flag as audit gap and suggest adding comprehensive process audit rights.","**Compliance Review: Audit Rights and Processes**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the audit rights and processes are not explicitly outlined, creating a compliance gap. To address this, I recommend adding comprehensive process audit rights to ensure transparency and accountability.

**Audit Scope**: The agreement does not specify the scope of the audit, which is crucial for identifying the areas to be reviewed. To rectify this, I suggest adding a clause that outlines the specific areas to be audited, such as financial records, customer data, and system configurations.

**Methodology Requirements**: The agreement does not provide any guidance on the methodology to be used for audits. To ensure consistency and effectiveness, I recommend adding a clause that outlines the required methodology, including the use of independent auditors and the frequency of audits.

**Documentation Access**: The agreement does not specify the level of access required for auditors to review documentation. To ensure compliance, I suggest adding a clause that outlines the specific documentation to be made available, including financial records, customer data, and system configurations.

**Testing Permissions**: The agreement does not provide any guidance on testing permissions, which is essential for ensuring the accuracy of audit results. To address this, I recommend adding a clause that outlines the specific testing permissions required, including the ability to test system configurations and customer data.

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit regulatory inspection rights.","Compliance Review: Regulatory Body Inspections

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there are no explicit provisions allowing regulatory body inspections. This is a compliance concern, as regulatory bodies may need to inspect Atlassian's premises, systems, or records to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

Access Scope: The agreement does not specify the scope of access that regulatory bodies may have during an inspection. It is unclear whether regulatory bodies will have unrestricted access to Atlassian's premises, systems, or records.

Notice Requirements: There are no notice requirements specified in the agreement for regulatory bodies to notify Atlassian of an impending inspection. This could lead to a situation where Atlassian is not aware of an inspection and is not prepared to provide necessary information or access.

Cooperation Obligations: The agreement does not explicitly require Atlassian to cooperate with regulatory bodies during an inspection. While Atlassian may be required to comply with relevant laws and regulations, the agreement does not specify the level of cooperation expected.

Documentation Requirements: The agreement does not specify the documentation requirements for regulatory bodies during an inspection. It is unclear what records or information Atlassian must provide to regulatory bodies.

Information Sharing Protocols: The agreement does not specify the protocols for sharing information with regulatory bodies during an inspection. This could lead to a situation where Atlassian is not aware of the information that is being shared or the purpose of the inspection.

Recommendation: To address these compliance concerns, I recommend adding explicit regulatory inspection rights to the agreement. This could include provisions such as:

* A clear statement of the scope of access that regulatory bodies may have during an inspection
* Notice requirements for regulatory bodies to notify Atlassian of an impending inspection
* Cooperation obligations for Atlassian to provide necessary information or access during an inspection
* Documentation requirements for regulatory bodies to provide records or information during an inspection
* Protocols for sharing information with regulatory bodies during an inspection

By adding these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that it is prepared to comply with regulatory requirements and can provide necessary information or access to regulatory bodies during an inspection."

The review of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans reveals that the current plans are incomplete and do not meet the required standards. Specifically, the plans lack essential components, such as:

* **Plan components**: The plans do not include a clear definition of the organization's critical business processes, identification of potential risks and threats, and a comprehensive risk assessment.
* **Alignment with operational needs**: The plans do not take into account the organization's operational needs, including the impact of disruptions on business operations, supply chains, and customer relationships.
* **Update frequency**: The plans are not reviewed and updated regularly, which may lead to outdated information and ineffective response strategies.
* **Testing requirements**: The plans do not specify testing requirements, including the frequency, scope, and participants involved in testing exercises.
* **Documentation standards**: The plans do not adhere to standardized documentation formats, making it difficult to track changes and updates.

**Resilience Gap:**

The lack of comprehensive BCDR requirements poses a significant resilience gap, which can lead to:

* Inadequate response to disruptions, resulting in business downtime and revenue loss.
* Ineffective communication and coordination among stakeholders, leading to confusion and delays.
* Insufficient training and preparedness for employees, increasing the risk of errors and mistakes during crisis situations.

**Recommendation:**

To address the resilience gap, I suggest adding comprehensive BCDR requirements to the organization's policies and procedures. This should include:

* Developing a clear and concise BCDR plan that outlines the organization's critical business processes, risk assessment, and response strategies.
* Establishing a regular review and update schedule for the BCDR plan to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
* Defining testing requirements, including the frequency, scope, and participants involved in testing exercises.
* Adhering to standardized documentation formats to ensure easy tracking of changes and updates.
* Providing training and awareness programs for employees to ensure they are prepared to respond effectively during crisis situations.

By implementing these recommendations, the organization can strengthen its BCDR capabilities, reduce the risk of disruptions, and ensure business continuity."

* Either party may terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term if the other party fails to cure a material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within 30 days after notice (Section 12.3).
* Customer may terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term if Atlassian materially decreases the functionality or overall security of the Products during the applicable Subscription Term (Section 11.1).

**Notice Requirements:**

* Customer must provide notice to Atlassian of its intention to terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term (Section 12.2).
* Atlassian must provide notice to Customer of its intention to terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term (Section 12.3).
* Notice must be in writing and may be provided by email, mail, or other reasonable means (Section 20.5).

**Material Breach Definitions:**

* A material breach of this Agreement includes a failure to pay fees (Section 12.3).
* A material breach of this Agreement also includes a failure to comply with the Acceptable Use Policy (Section 2.2).

**Non-Compliance Criteria:**

* Customer must not breach Section 2.2 (Restrictions) or Section 6 (Customer Obligations) (Section 14.3).
* Customer must not breach Section 16 (Confidentiality) (Section 14.3).

* Atlassian must provide Customer with reasonable notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term (Section 12.3).
* Customer must cooperate with Atlassian in the termination process, including providing access to Customer Materials and personnel reasonably requested by Atlassian (Section 8).

However, I recommend adding detailed termination provisions to the agreement, including:

* A clear definition of material breach and non-compliance criteria
* A specific process for terminating the agreement, including notice requirements and timelines
* A provision for termination fees or penalties
* A provision for the return or destruction of confidential information
* A provision for the handling of customer data in the event of termination

These additional provisions would provide clarity and certainty for both parties in the event of termination, and would help to prevent disputes and misunderstandings."
