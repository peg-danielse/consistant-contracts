"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following relevant clause that addresses the retained responsibility of the financial entity for DORA compliance:

**Section 20.1. Compliance with Laws**

""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

This clause does not specifically mention DORA, but it does imply that both parties are responsible for complying with applicable laws, including DORA regulations. However, it does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance.

**Section 20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates**

""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

This clause mentions that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance, but it does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance.

**Section 20.1. Compliance with Laws**

""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

This clause is similar to the first one mentioned, but it does not specifically address the retained responsibility of the financial entity for DORA compliance.

However, I found a clause that addresses the non-transfer of compliance obligations:

**Section 15.5. Exceptions**

""Atlassian’s obligations in this Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) do not apply to the extent an Infringement Claim arises from: (a) Customer’s modification or unauthorized use of the Products, (b) use of the Products in combination with items not provided by Atlassian (including Third-Party Products), (c) any unsupported release of the Software Products or Cloud Clients, or (d) Third-Party Products, Customer Data or Customer Materials.""

This clause does not directly address DORA compliance, but it does imply that the financial entity retains responsibility for its own actions and modifications to the Products.

Unfortunately, I did not find any explicit clauses that clearly state the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, references DORA obligations, or acknowledges that outsourcing does not diminish the entity's responsibility. However, the clauses mentioned above do imply that the financial entity is responsible for complying with applicable laws, including DORA regulations, and that outsourcing does not diminish its responsibility."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:

 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws is not explicitly stated. While the agreement does acknowledge the customer's payment obligations under Sections 10.1 (Fees) and 10.2 (Taxes), it does not clearly outline the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws.

Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations is not explicitly stated in the agreement. Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all Laws applicable to its business, but it does not specify which financial services laws are applicable to the financial entity.

Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities is also not explicitly stated in the agreement. While the agreement does require the customer to comply with all applicable Laws, it does not prohibit the financial entity from delegating its regulatory responsibilities to a third party.

Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations is not explicitly stated in the agreement. While the agreement requires the customer to provide valid documentation for tax exemptions, it does not acknowledge the financial entity's ongoing regulatory obligations.

References to specific financial services laws are not explicitly stated in the agreement. While the agreement does reference the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in Section 6.3 (Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA), it does not reference other relevant financial services laws.

To address these gaps, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the agreement that covers the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should include:

* A comprehensive list of all applicable financial services laws that the financial entity is responsible for complying with
* A clear statement that the financial entity retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws
* A provision that prohibits the financial entity from delegating its regulatory responsibilities to a third party
* A clear acknowledgment of the financial entity's ongoing regulatory obligations
* A reference to specific financial services laws that are applicable to the financial entity's business

Example of the recommended clause:

""Financial Entity's Retained Responsibility for Financial Services Laws

The Financial Entity retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws, including but not limited to [list specific laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Anti-Money Laundering regulations]. The Financial Entity will comply with all applicable financial services laws and regulations, and will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to a third party. The Financial Entity acknowledges its ongoing regulatory obligations and will provide documentation and information to the Customer as required by applicable law.""

By adding this clause, the agreement will provide clear and comprehensive coverage of the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws."

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there are no explicit provisions requiring senior management or board approval of ICT service agreements. This is a governance gap that needs to be addressed to ensure that the organization's ICT services are aligned with its overall business objectives and strategic direction.

**Approval Requirements**

The agreement does not specify any approval requirements for senior management or the board of directors. This means that there is no formal process in place to ensure that ICT service agreements are reviewed and approved by the relevant stakeholders before they are executed.

**Review Procedures**

While the agreement outlines the terms and conditions of the service, it does not provide a clear review process for senior management or the board to review and approve ICT service agreements. This lack of clarity may lead to inadequate oversight and potentially expose the organization to risks associated with unapproved ICT service agreements.

**Documentation of Approvals**

There is no provision in the agreement that requires documentation of approvals for ICT service agreements. This means that there is no record of who approved the agreement, when it was approved, and under what circumstances.

**Renewal Approval Processes**

The agreement does not specify any renewal approval processes for ICT service agreements. This means that the organization may not have a formal process in place to review and approve renewals of ICT service agreements, which may lead to unnecessary costs or exposure to risks.

**Recommendation**

To address this governance gap, I recommend that the organization adds explicit board/senior management approval requirements for ICT service agreements. This should include:

* A clear approval process for ICT service agreements, including a review and approval by senior management or the board of directors
* A documentation requirement for approvals, including the date, time, and details of the approval
* A renewal approval process for ICT service agreements, including a review and approval by senior management or the board of directors

By implementing these measures, the organization can ensure that its ICT services are aligned with its overall business objectives and strategic direction, and that there is adequate oversight and control over ICT service agreements."

 • Board notification procedures

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding comprehensive escalation framework with specific triggers and procedures.","**Compliance Requirement: Documented Escalation Paths for Unresolved Third-Party Risks**

A comprehensive escalation framework is essential to ensure timely and effective management of unresolved third-party risks. The absence of a clear escalation process can lead to delayed resolution, increased risk, and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Escalation Triggers:**

A documented escalation framework should outline specific triggers for escalating unresolved third-party risks. These triggers may include:

* Third-party risk assessment scores exceeding a certain threshold (e.g., 3.5 or higher)
* Unresolved issues or findings from audits or assessments
* Changes to third-party risk profiles or risk exposure
* Non-compliance with regulatory requirements or industry standards

**Escalation Levels:**

A clear escalation framework should define multiple levels of escalation, each with specific responsibilities and time frames for resolution. These levels may include:

* Level 1: Initial escalation to a third-party risk management team or designated personnel
* Level 2: Escalation to a senior management team or board representative
* Level 3: Final escalation to the board of directors or audit committee

**Time Frames for Escalation:**

A documented escalation framework should specify time frames for each escalation level, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly. These time frames may include:

To fill this gap, I suggest adding a section on record-keeping requirements, including the types of information that must be recorded, such as the date, time, and details of the escalation, as well as any subsequent follow-up activities.

**Tracking Mechanisms**: The Agreement does not explicitly outline tracking mechanisms for escalation processes. However, it does mention the use of Atlassian's support portal for tracking support requests (Section 9: Ordering Process and Delivery). To address this gap, I recommend incorporating a section on tracking mechanisms, such as the use of a ticketing system or a project management tool, to ensure that escalations are properly tracked and monitored.

**Follow-up Procedures**: The Agreement does not explicitly outline follow-up procedures for escalation processes. However, it does mention the need for Customer to cooperate with Atlassian in any investigation or resolution of an issue (Section 15: Indemnification by Atlassian). To fill this gap, I suggest adding a section on follow-up procedures, including the frequency and method of follow-up, as well as any specific actions that must be taken in response to an escalation.

Follow-up if Missing: Flag as gap and recommend adding comprehensive criticality assessment framework.","Compliance Requirement: Establish a Comprehensive Criticality Assessment Framework

To ensure the effectiveness of our service, process, or function criticality assessment, we must implement a structured methodology to evaluate the criticality of our products and services. This requires the development of a comprehensive criticality assessment framework that incorporates the following essential components:

**Criticality Assessment Criteria:**

Our criticality assessment framework will be based on the following criteria:

1. **Impact on Business Operations:** Evaluate the potential impact on our business operations, including revenue, customer satisfaction, and brand reputation.
2. **Risk of Non-Compliance:** Assess the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal policies.
3. **Customer Expectations:** Consider customer expectations and the potential impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty.
4. **Financial Implications:** Evaluate the potential financial implications, including costs associated with non-compliance, fines, and reputational damage.
5. **Security and Data Protection:** Assess the potential impact on the security and protection of customer data.

**Classification Levels:**

We will establish a classification system to categorize the criticality of our products and services into the following levels:

1. **Critical:** High impact on business operations, risk of non-compliance, and potential financial implications.
2. **High:** Significant impact on business operations, moderate risk of non-compliance, and potential financial implications.
3. **Medium:** Moderate impact on business operations, low risk of non-compliance, and limited financial implications.
4. **Low:** Limited impact on business operations, low risk of non-compliance, and minimal financial implications.

**Impact Thresholds:**

To ensure consistency in our criticality assessment, we will establish impact thresholds for each classification level. For example:

1. **Critical:** Any impact exceeding 10% on business operations, 5% risk of non-compliance, or $100,000 in financial implications will be classified as critical.
2. **High:** Any impact between 5% and 10% on business operations, 2% to 5% risk of non-compliance, or $50,000 to $100,000 in financial implications will be classified as high.
3. **Medium:** Any impact between 1% and 5% on business operations, 1% to 2% risk of non-compliance, or $10,000 to $50,000 in financial implications will be classified as medium.
4. **Low:** Any impact below 1% on business operations, 0% risk of non-compliance, or less than $10,000 in financial implications will be classified as low.

**Review Requirements:**

To ensure the effectiveness of our criticality assessment framework, we will review and update our classification levels and impact thresholds annually, or as necessary. This will involve:

1. **Regular Review:** Conduct regular reviews of our products and services to assess their criticality.
2. **Risk Assessment:** Perform risk assessments to identify potential risks and impacts.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Engage with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and partners, to gather feedback and insights.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously improve our criticality assessment framework to ensure it remains effective and relevant.

By implementing a comprehensive criticality assessment framework, we can ensure that our products and services are aligned with our business objectives and regulatory requirements, and that we are prepared to address any potential risks and impacts."

The Agreement does not specify review procedures for documentation. However, Section 16.2 (Obligations) requires that Confidential Information, including documentation, be held in confidence and not disclosed to third parties without permission.

**Approval Processes**

The Agreement does not outline explicit approval processes for documentation. However, Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement) implies that Atlassian may need to obtain customer approval for certain changes to the Agreement, which may affect documentation requirements.

**Follow-up and Recommendation**

Given the lack of explicit documentation standards, update requirements, review procedures, and approval processes, I recommend implementing structured documentation requirements for critical functions and processes. This will ensure that critical information is accurately documented, up-to-date, and accessible for review and approval. To achieve this, Atlassian should:

1. Establish clear documentation standards for critical functions and processes.
2. Define update requirements for documentation to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.
3. Develop review procedures to ensure documentation is regularly reviewed and updated.
4. Establish approval processes for documentation to ensure that changes are properly authorized and documented.
