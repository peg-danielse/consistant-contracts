"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","**Compliance Finding:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement explicitly retains the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance through clear statements and references to DORA obligations. Specifically, Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business, including DORA obligations. Furthermore, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) acknowledges that outsourcing does not diminish the entity's responsibility for compliance, stating that ""Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

Additionally, Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) does not contain any language that would suggest the transfer of compliance obligations to Atlassian or any other third party. This indicates that the financial entity retains full responsibility for ensuring compliance with DORA obligations.

**Key Clauses:**

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws): ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""
* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates): ""Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

**Conclusion:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement clearly retains the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance, acknowledging that outsourcing does not diminish the entity's responsibility. This ensures that the financial entity remains accountable for ensuring compliance with DORA obligations throughout the agreement."

 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","**Compliance Review: Financial Entity's Retained Responsibility for Financial Services Laws**

The contract reviewed does not explicitly address the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. While the contract mentions compliance with ""all Laws applicable to its business"" in Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws), it does not provide comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations, nor does it explicitly acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations.

**Missing Elements:**

1. **Comprehensive Coverage of All Applicable Regulations:** The contract does not reference specific financial services laws, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.
2. **Non-Delegation of Regulatory Responsibilities:** The contract does not explicitly state that the financial entity will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to third-party vendors or subcontractors.
3. **Clear Acknowledgment of Ongoing Regulatory Obligations:** The contract does not explicitly acknowledge the financial entity's ongoing regulatory obligations, such as regular audits, risk assessments, and compliance reporting.

**Recommendation:**

To address these gaps, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the contract that covers the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should:

* Reference specific financial services laws and regulations
* Acknowledge the financial entity's ongoing regulatory obligations
* Prohibit the delegation of regulatory responsibilities to third-party vendors or subcontractors
* Require the financial entity to maintain comprehensive records of its compliance efforts

Example of the recommended clause:

**Retention of Regulatory Responsibilities**

The Financial Entity retains full responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws and regulations, including but not limited to [list specific laws and regulations, e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR, AML]. The Financial Entity acknowledges its ongoing regulatory obligations and agrees to maintain comprehensive records of its compliance efforts. The Financial Entity will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to third-party vendors or subcontractors without prior written consent from [Atlassian's name]. The Financial Entity will ensure that all personnel involved in the provision of financial services are aware of and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

By adding this clause, the contract will provide clear and comprehensive coverage of the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and minimizing the risk of non-compliance."
