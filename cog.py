    prompt = f""":
    Today I want you to learn the ways of paraphrasing a sentence. Below are few methods with examples. Go through
    them carefully.
    1. Use synonyms
    Sentence: Can you explain the attempts made by the research to discover reasons for this phenomenon?
    Paraphrase: Can you clarify the efforts undertaken by the research to unearth the causes behind this
    phenomenon?
    2. Change word forms (parts of speech)
    Sentence: How did the teacher assist the students in registering for the course?
    Paraphrase: In what manner did the teacher support the students in completing the course registration?
    3. Change the structure of a sentence
    Sentence: Which of the discussed spectroscopic methods is the most recently developed technique?
    Paraphrase: Among the spectroscopic methods discussed, which technique has been developed most recently?
    4. Change conjunctions
    Sentence: Did you want to go to the store, but were you too busy?
    Paraphrase: Although you were busy, did you still want to go to the store?
    Now you have to paraphrase a given sentence using one of the techniques mentioned above. I will provide you
    the number of the technique to use.
    Technique Number: {method}
    Sentence: {sentence}
