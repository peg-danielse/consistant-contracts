"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","**Compliance Retention Clause Identified**

Article 28 of the Regulation explicitly states that financial entities ""shall manage ICT third-party risk as an integral component of ICT risk within their ICT risk management framework... and in accordance with the following principles"" (Article 28, Section 1). This indicates that financial entities retain full responsibility for managing ICT third-party risk, including compliance with DORA obligations.

Furthermore, Section 2 of Article 28 outlines the principles for managing ICT third-party risk, including the principle of proportionality, which requires financial entities to assess the risks arising from contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers (Article 28, Section 2). This suggests that financial entities are responsible for ensuring that their outsourcing arrangements do not diminish their responsibility for DORA compliance.

Additionally, Section 3 of Article 28 requires financial entities to maintain a register of information related to contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers, which includes information on the types of ICT services and functions being provided (Article 28, Section 3). This indicates that financial entities are responsible for tracking and managing their ICT third-party risk, including compliance with DORA obligations.

Finally, Section 4 of Article 28 outlines the requirements for financial entities to assess and manage ICT third-party risk before entering into contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers (Article 28, Section 4). This includes conducting due diligence on prospective ICT third-party service providers and identifying and assessing relevant risks, including the potential for ICT concentration risk (Article 28, Section 4). This suggests that financial entities retain full responsibility for ensuring that their outsourcing arrangements comply with DORA obligations.

In summary, the Regulation explicitly states that financial entities retain full responsibility for managing ICT third-party risk, including compliance with DORA obligations, and that outsourcing does not diminish their responsibility for DORA compliance."
