This repository is the collection point for the software and results to perform measurements on the consistency of the output of llms. To do this the experiment.py loads in a list of prompts and a chosen model. then using the lama3 library we prompt the model using a dialogue that contains the context and the document under review. The bert.py file contains the code to analyse and create similarity scores from the answers generated by the model.

### Runnin the lama3 model and compare the answers.
The results produced are from the llama3.1-8B-Instruct model. To use this software please read the experiment.py code and inform yourself on the fire, torch and llama3 libraries.

first download a model using the hugginface service.

```export $CHECKPOINT_DIR=./.checkpoints/llama3/Llama3.1-8B-Instruct/```

then run the experiment file.

```python -m torch.distributed experiment.py {label: str} {chkpoint_dir: str} {temperature: float} {top_p: float} {max_tokens: int} {seed: int} {out_path: str} {language: str} {cog: bool}```

for more info on how to perform the experiments read the scripts in the scripts folder.
