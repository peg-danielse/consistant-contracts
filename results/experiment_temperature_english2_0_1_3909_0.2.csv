"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I found that there is no explicit mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. However, I did find some clauses that indirectly address the issue.

Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not ""rent, lease, sell, distribute or sublicense the Products or (except for Affiliates) include them in a service bureau or outsourcing offering."" This clause implies that the Products are not easily substitutable, as Customer is restricted from using them in a way that would allow for easy substitution with another provider.

Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. This clause suggests that Atlassian has the right to verify whether Customer is using the Software Products in a way that is consistent with the contract, which could imply that the Products are not easily substitutable.

However, I did not find any explicit clauses that address the substitutability of the provider. Therefore, I flag this as a gap in the contract.

**Gap:** The contract does not include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider, which is an important consideration for ensuring that the Customer has flexibility in case the provider is unable to meet its obligations.

**Recommendation:** The contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider, such as defining criteria for determining substitutability, e.g., the ability to easily switch to another provider without significant disruption to the business, the level of customization required, or the existence of proprietary dependencies. This would provide clarity and ensure that the Customer has the necessary flexibility to adapt to changes in the market or the provider's performance."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have determined that the contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. While the contract mentions the need for Customer to ensure that all Users comply with the Agreement and that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the Scope of Use, it does not provide clear guidelines for assessing substitutability.

To address this gap, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

1. Cost: The contract could specify that substitutability will be assessed based on the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the new product or service, including any additional costs associated with implementation, training, and support.
2. Technical specifications: The contract could outline the technical requirements for substitutability, such as compatibility with existing systems, data formats, and interfaces.
3. Ease of transition: The contract could establish a framework for evaluating the ease of transition from the existing product or service to the new one, including factors such as data migration, user training, and system integration.

Possible benchmarks based on industry standards could include:

* The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9126 standard for software quality, which provides guidelines for evaluating software quality attributes such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability.
* The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) standard, which provides a framework for evaluating an organization's process maturity and capability.
* The ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) standard, which provides guidelines for evaluating IT service management processes and practices.

By incorporating these criteria and benchmarks, the contract can provide a more comprehensive framework for assessing substitutability and ensuring that any changes to the products or services meet the necessary standards for quality, functionality, and usability."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","**Compliance Statement:** The contract between Atlassian and the Customer requires documentation of alternative providers in the market, but there are gaps in the documentation requirements.

Upon reviewing the contract, I found that Section 7.2, ""Third-Party Products,"" mentions that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products""). However, it does not explicitly require documentation of these alternative providers.

Furthermore, Section 7.2 states that ""Customer's use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider's terms of use, not this Agreement."" This implies that the Customer is responsible for ensuring compliance with the terms of use of these alternative providers, but it does not require documentation of these terms or the providers themselves.

**Missing Documentation Requirements:**

1. **List of Alternative Providers:** There is no requirement to maintain a list of alternative providers that the Customer may use with the Products.
2. **Documentation of Third-Party Terms of Use:** The contract does not require the Customer to document the terms of use of alternative providers, which may lead to compliance issues.
3. **Regular Market Scans:** There is no requirement for the Customer to conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers, which may result in missed opportunities for cost savings or improved services.

**Recommendation:** To address these gaps, I recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This clause should require the Customer to:

* Conduct regular market scans to identify alternative providers that meet the Customer's needs
* Document the terms of use and pricing of these alternative providers
* Maintain a list of alternative providers and their corresponding documentation
* Review and update this list regularly to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date

By including this clause, the contract can ensure that the Customer is aware of and compliant with the terms of use of alternative providers, and that the list of alternative providers is regularly updated to reflect changes in the market."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that requires a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers, specifically in Section 20.15, which states: ""The Products, Support and Advisory Services in each Order are purchased separately and not contingent on purchase or use of other Atlassian products and services, even if listed in the same Order.""

However, this provision does not explicitly require a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Instead, it emphasizes the non-contingent nature of each Order.

To confirm whether a cost-benefit analysis is considered, I have searched the Agreement and found that Section 10.1 (Fees) mentions that Atlassian may charge Customer for any increased Scope of Use at Atlassian's then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term. This provision implies that Customer should consider the costs of increased Scope of Use when making decisions about their use of the Products.

However, I did not find any explicit requirement for a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. To maintain strategic flexibility, I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to ensure that Customer considers financial, operational, and strategic factors when evaluating their use of the Products and potential alternatives.

Specifically, I recommend adding a provision that requires Customer to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers at regular intervals, such as every 12 months, to ensure that they are making informed decisions about their use of the Products and to maintain strategic flexibility. This provision could be added to Section 10.1 (Fees) or a new section, such as Section 10.2 (Cost-Benefit Analysis).

For example:

""10.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis

Customer must conduct a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers at least once every 12 months to ensure that they are making informed decisions about their use of the Products and to maintain strategic flexibility. The analysis must consider financial, operational, and strategic factors, including but not limited to:

* The costs of using the Products compared to alternative providers
* The operational benefits and drawbacks of using the Products compared to alternative providers
* The strategic implications of using the Products compared to alternative providers

Customer must provide Atlassian with a written report of the cost-benefit analysis, including any recommendations for changes to their use of the Products or potential alternatives."""
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clause that addresses the need for awareness of market alternatives:

**Section 2.2 (Restrictions)**: This section states that Customer must not use the Products to develop a similar or competing product or service. However, it does not explicitly require Customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives.

**Section 6.2 (Product Assessment)**: This section states that Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer's requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use. While this section implies that Customer should be aware of market alternatives, it does not explicitly require periodic market research.

**Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws)**: This section requires Customer to comply with all Laws applicable to its business, including those related to competition and antitrust laws. However, it does not specifically address the need for periodic market reviews.

**Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement)**: This section allows Atlassian to modify the Agreement, including the Policies, Product-Specific Terms, and DPA, from time to time. While this section does not explicitly require Customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives, it implies that Atlassian may introduce new features or functionality that could impact Customer's market position.

**Validation**: Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require Customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives through periodic market research. However, the Agreement does imply that Customer should be aware of market alternatives and regulatory obligations related to its intended use.

**Recommendation**: I recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives, as follows:

* Section 6.2 (Product Assessment): Add a sentence to require Customer to conduct periodic market research to evaluate emerging alternatives and assess whether the Products continue to meet Customer's requirements.
* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws): Add a sentence to require Customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives and regulatory obligations related to its intended use.
* Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement): Add a sentence to require Atlassian to notify Customer of any changes to the Agreement that may impact Customer's market position or regulatory obligations.

By adding these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that Customer remains aware of market alternatives and regulatory obligations, and can take steps to adapt its business accordingly."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there is no explicit requirement to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. However, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not provide access to the Products to a third party, other than to Users, which implies that Customer should have a clear understanding of its existing arrangements with the provider.

Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use, but this is not a periodic review of existing arrangements.

Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all Laws applicable to its business, which may include laws related to contract management and review.

To address the gap, I recommend including a periodic review of all existing contracts with the provider, as follows:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) should be updated to explicitly require Customer to review and assess its existing arrangements with the provider, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements.
* Section 5.2 (License Verification) should be updated to include a periodic review of Customer's use of the Software Products to ensure compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.
* A new section, such as Section 20.2 (Contract Review), should be added to require Customer to conduct periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider, including:
	+ Reviewing the number, type, and scope of existing arrangements with the provider.
	+ Assessing compliance with the contract terms and conditions.
	+ Identifying any gaps or areas for improvement.
	+ Updating the contract as necessary to reflect changes in Customer's business or the provider's services.

By including these requirements, Customer can ensure that it has a clear understanding of its existing arrangements with the provider and can take steps to optimize its contract management practices."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions that require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Specifically, Section 7.2 ""Third-Party Products"" mentions that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products""). This section highlights the potential risks associated with using Third-Party Products, stating that ""Customer's use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer's behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product.""

However, I did not find any specific provisions that require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers or the documentation of such relationships in the contract. Therefore, I flag the absence of these requirements and suggest including provisions to evaluate risks from connected providers.

To address this, I recommend adding a clause that requires Customer to:

* Identify and document all closely connected providers used in conjunction with the Products
* Assess the risks associated with using these connected providers, including the potential impact on Customer Data and other data
* Develop a plan to mitigate any identified risks, including implementing controls to ensure the secure handling of Customer Data and other data

This would help ensure that Customer is aware of the potential risks associated with using connected providers and takes steps to mitigate them, thereby reducing the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements and minimizing potential harm to Customer Data and other data."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses that relate to the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Specifically, Section 20.13 ""Export Restrictions"" mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. However, this clause does not directly address the concentration risk.

A more relevant clause is Section 20.11 ""Subcontractors and Affiliates"", which states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. This clause implies that Atlassian may rely on a single provider for multiple services, which could potentially create concentration risks.

However, the contract does not explicitly require tracking dependency on the provider. To address this, I recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks, such as:

**Concentration Risk Management**

Atlassian acknowledges that relying on a single provider for multiple services may create concentration risks. To mitigate these risks, Atlassian will:

* Identify and assess the concentration risks associated with its reliance on a single provider for multiple services.
* Develop and implement a plan to diversify its service providers, if necessary.
* Regularly review and update its service provider arrangements to ensure that concentration risks are minimized.

By adding this section, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to managing concentration risks and ensuring business continuity."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that assesses interdependencies between services provided by third-party providers.

**Interdependencies between Third-Party Products**

Section 7.2 of the Agreement states:

""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.""

This provision acknowledges that the use of third-party products with Atlassian's products may create interdependencies between services, which can amplify operational risks.

**Recommendation**

To further mitigate these risks, I suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This could be achieved by adding a clause to the Agreement that requires customers to:

* Conduct a risk assessment of their use of third-party products with Atlassian's products
* Identify potential interdependencies between services
* Develop a plan to mitigate any identified risks

This would help ensure that customers are aware of the potential risks associated with using third-party products and can take steps to mitigate them.

**Proposed Clause**

""7.2.1 Interdependencies between Third-Party Products

Customer acknowledges that the use of Third-Party Products with the Products may create interdependencies between services, which can amplify operational risks. Customer agrees to conduct a risk assessment of its use of Third-Party Products and identify potential interdependencies between services. Customer will develop a plan to mitigate any identified risks and ensure that its use of Third-Party Products does not compromise the security or integrity of the Products or Customer Data."""
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a clause that addresses the provider's market share and concentration risk.

**Section 20.13: Export Restrictions**

The clause states that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. Customer must comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products. This clause indirectly implies that Atlassian may have a significant market share and concentration risk, as it is subject to export restrictions and import restrictions.

However, I have not found any explicit clauses that assess or address the provider's market share and concentration risk. Specifically, there are no clauses that:

* Evaluate the provider's market share and concentration risk
* Assess the potential impact of provider dominance on resilience
* Address monopoly risks or limited alternatives

To address this gap, I recommend adding terms to the agreement that:

* Require Atlassian to disclose its market share and concentration risk
* Assess the potential impact of provider dominance on resilience
* Address monopoly risks or limited alternatives

This would help ensure that the customer is aware of the potential risks associated with Atlassian's market dominance and can make informed decisions about its use of the Products.

**Recommendation:**

Add the following terms to the agreement:

* Section 20.14: Market Share and Concentration Risk Disclosure
	+ Atlassian shall disclose its market share and concentration risk to Customer upon request.
	+ Atlassian shall assess the potential impact of provider dominance on resilience and provide a report to Customer.
* Section 20.15: Monopoly Risks and Limited Alternatives
	+ Atlassian shall address monopoly risks and limited alternatives in its provision of the Products.
	+ Atlassian shall provide Customer with information about alternative providers and their offerings.

By adding these terms, the agreement would better address the provider's market share and concentration risk, ensuring that the customer is aware of the potential risks and can make informed decisions about its use of the Products."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","Upon reviewing the contract, I confirm that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. The contract does not address location-specific factors such as infrastructure reliability or natural disasters that could impact the provider's ability to deliver services.

However, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) of the contract specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland for customers domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of the State of California for customers elsewhere. This provision may imply a certain level of geographical concentration risk, as it suggests that the provider may be subject to different regulatory environments and laws in various regions.

To mitigate this risk, I recommend that the contract include a geographical risk assessment that addresses location-specific factors such as infrastructure reliability, natural disasters, and regulatory environments. This assessment should be conducted by the provider and made available to the customer upon request. The assessment should identify potential risks and provide a plan for mitigating or managing those risks.

Specifically, the contract should include language such as:

""The Provider shall conduct a geographical risk assessment to identify potential risks associated with location-specific factors such as infrastructure reliability, natural disasters, and regulatory environments. The Provider shall make this assessment available to the Customer upon request and provide a plan for mitigating or managing any identified risks.""

By including this provision, the contract can better address the geographical concentration risks associated with the provider's operations and provide greater transparency and accountability for the provider."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules:

**Clause 4.2 (Security Program)**: Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This program includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.

**Clause 4.1 (Customer Data)**: Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.

**Clause 16 (Confidentiality)**: The receiving party must hold the disclosing party's Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement.

These clauses suggest that Atlassian requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, to ensure compliance with EU data protection rules, I recommend including the following provisions:

* A clear statement that third-country providers must comply with EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR.
* A requirement for third-country providers to implement data protection measures that meet EU standards, such as the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.
* A provision for regular audits and certifications to ensure compliance with EU data protection regulations.

To validate these provisions, I suggest the following:

* Review the Atlassian Customer Agreement to ensure that these clauses are comprehensive and cover all aspects of data protection.
* Verify that Atlassian's Security Measures and Security Program are aligned with EU data protection regulations.
* Consult with EU data protection experts to ensure that the provisions meet EU data protection standards.

**Flagged absence:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations. To address this, I recommend including a clause that explicitly requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, such as:

""Third-country providers must comply with EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR, and implement data protection measures that meet EU standards. Atlassian will ensure that all third-country providers undergo regular audits and certifications to ensure compliance with EU data protection regulations."""
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several clauses that assess the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, particularly in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.

The agreement explicitly states that the laws of the Republic of Ireland will govern the agreement if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and the laws of the State of California will govern if the customer is domiciled elsewhere (Section 20.4). This indicates that Atlassian has considered the jurisdiction-specific laws and regulations that may impact contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.

Furthermore, the agreement includes a clause that requires customers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction (Section 20.1). This provision demonstrates Atlassian's commitment to ensuring that customers comply with local laws and regulations, thereby mitigating potential legal risks.

Additionally, the agreement includes a clause that addresses the use of the provider's products and services in countries subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions (Section 20.13). This provision highlights Atlassian's awareness of the importance of complying with export control regulations and ensuring that its products and services are not used in a manner that would violate such regulations.

However, I recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider's country, as suggested in the follow-up. This could include:

* A clause that requires Atlassian to conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential legal risks in its jurisdiction
* A provision that outlines the procedures for addressing and mitigating identified legal risks
* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide customers with information about the legal risks associated with using its products and services in their jurisdiction

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can further demonstrate its commitment to ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance, and provide customers with greater transparency and confidence in its products and services."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions:

**Clause 4.2: Security Program**

Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures. Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.

**Clause 4.1: Customer Data**

Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement. This clause implies that Atlassian may process Customer Data in various jurisdictions, including third-country jurisdictions.

**Clause 16: Confidentiality**

This clause requires both parties to maintain confidentiality of each other's Confidential Information, including Customer Data. However, it does not explicitly address data localization requirements or associated risks.

**Clause 20.13: Export Restrictions**

This clause requires Customer to comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products. This includes restrictions on exporting, re-exporting, transferring, or disclosing the Products or any direct product of the Products to certain jurisdictions.

**Recommendation**

To align with regulatory and operational needs, I suggest adding data localization provisions to the agreement, specifically:

1. Specify the jurisdictions where Customer Data will be processed and stored.
2. Outline the measures Atlassian will take to ensure compliance with data localization requirements in third-country jurisdictions.
3. Define the procedures for handling data requests from regulatory authorities in third-country jurisdictions.
4. Establish clear guidelines for data transfer and storage in third-country jurisdictions.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure compliance with data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions, while also maintaining the confidentiality and security of Customer Data."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a gap in the contract regarding country-specific operational risks. The agreement does not contain provisions that assess or address potential risks associated with operating in specific countries, such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues.

This omission is concerning, as it may leave Atlassian and its customers vulnerable to unforeseen risks and challenges in certain countries. For instance, if a customer is based in a country with a high risk of political instability, the agreement does not provide a clear framework for addressing potential disruptions to service or data security concerns.

To mitigate these risks, I recommend adding a provision to the contract that requires Atlassian to conduct a country-specific risk assessment for each customer. This assessment should consider factors such as:

* Political stability and potential for disruptions
* Local laws and regulations that may impact service delivery
* Infrastructure and connectivity issues
* Data security and protection requirements

By incorporating this provision, Atlassian can better understand and manage country-specific risks, ensuring that its customers receive reliable and secure services, regardless of their location. This will also enable Atlassian to provide more informed and tailored support to its customers, addressing their unique needs and concerns.

In the absence of such a provision, I suggest adding a clause that requires Atlassian to:

* Conduct a country-specific risk assessment for each customer prior to commencing service delivery
* Provide a written report outlining the identified risks and mitigation strategies
* Develop a plan to address and mitigate any identified risks
* Regularly review and update the risk assessment to ensure ongoing compliance with local laws and regulations

By incorporating this provision, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to managing country-specific operational risks and providing a secure and reliable service to its customers worldwide."

Upon reviewing the contract, I found that Section 5.2, ""License Verification,"" mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. However, this clause does not specifically address critical risk assessments.

Additionally, Section 20.11, ""Subcontractors and Affiliates,"" states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. This clause does not explicitly require regular risk assessments.

**Recommendation:** To maintain operational resilience, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments of the ICT third-party provider. This clause should be included in the contract and should specify the frequency of these assessments, such as quarterly or annually.

**Proposed Clause:** ""The parties agree to conduct regular critical risk assessments of the ICT third-party provider, at least once a year, to identify and mitigate potential risks to operational resilience. The results of these assessments will be documented and shared with both parties, and any necessary actions will be taken to address identified risks.""

**Validation:** This proposed clause is consistent with industry best practices for maintaining operational resilience and is in line with regulatory requirements for ICT third-party risk management."

However, this provision does not provide a clear plan for mitigating risks in the event of a security breach or other critical incident.

To address this gap, I recommend that the contract be amended to include explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. For example, the contract could include a contingency plan that outlines the steps that Atlassian will take in the event of a security breach, including notification to affected customers, containment of the breach, and restoration of services.

Additionally, the contract could include provisions for redundancies and alternative providers to ensure business continuity in the event of a critical incident. For example, the contract could require Atlassian to maintain a backup system or to have a plan in place for switching to an alternative provider in the event of a service disruption.

By including these provisions, the contract can provide greater clarity and transparency around Atlassian's risk mitigation measures and ensure that customers are protected in the event of a critical incident."

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all applicable Laws, including those related to incident reporting and security incident response.

Regulatory requirements for incident reporting timelines vary depending on the jurisdiction and the type of incident. However, many regulations require incident reporting within 24 hours for high-severity incidents. For example, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data controllers to notify the relevant supervisory authority of a personal data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it.

Given the absence of clear incident reporting timelines in the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I recommend including specific timelines for incident reporting to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to provide clarity on Atlassian's incident response procedures. This could include:

* Specifying a timeline for incident reporting, such as within 24 hours for high-severity incidents
* Defining what constitutes a high-severity incident
* Outlining the procedures for incident reporting, including the contact information for Atlassian's incident response team
* Ensuring that incident reporting timelines are aligned with regulatory requirements and industry best practices

By including clear incident reporting timelines, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to transparency and incident response, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements."

**Section 15: Indemnification by Atlassian**

* Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party (an ""Infringement Claim"").
* Atlassian must indemnify and hold harmless Customer against any damages, fines, or costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction (including reasonable attorneys' fees) or agreed in settlement by Atlassian resulting from an Infringement Claim.

While these sections do not explicitly outline escalation procedures, they do provide some guidance on how Atlassian will respond to customer complaints and issues. However, to ensure clear and effective incident escalation, I recommend adding an escalation matrix with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines for each escalation stage.

**Suggested Escalation Matrix**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is evident that resilience testing of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans is a critical aspect of ensuring the continuity of business operations. However, the agreement does not explicitly require resilience testing of BCDR plans.

Definitive Statement: The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks specific provisions requiring resilience testing of BCDR plans, which is a critical component of ensuring business continuity and disaster recovery.

Recommendation: To ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices, I recommend adding mandatory testing clauses to the agreement. This should include:

1. Testing frequency: Specify the frequency of resilience testing, such as quarterly or annually, to ensure that BCDR plans are regularly reviewed and updated.
2. Testing scope: Define the scope of resilience testing, including the types of tests to be conducted, such as data recovery, system restore, and business process testing.

Regulatory standards for incident reporting timelines vary depending on the jurisdiction and industry. However, some common standards include:

* GDPR: Article 33 requires that personal data breaches be notified to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.
* HIPAA: 45 CFR § 164.308(a)(1)(i) requires that covered entities report breaches of unsecured protected health information to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services within 60 days of discovery.
* PCI-DSS: Requirement 12.8.5 requires that cardholder data breaches be reported to the affected parties within 24 hours of discovery.

Based on these regulatory standards, the incident reporting timelines in the Atlassian Customer Agreement are not aligned with the most stringent standards. Specifically:

The agreement mandates corrective actions based on root cause findings, with a focus on addressing the underlying causes of non-compliance rather than just treating the symptoms.

Section 12.3 (Termination for Cause) outlines the procedures for termination of the agreement due to material breach, including failure to cure a breach within 30 days. This provision requires Atlassian to take corrective action to address the breach, which may include implementing new procedures, re-training staff, or providing additional support to the customer.

Similarly, Section 15.4 (Mitigation) requires Atlassian to take corrective action in response to an actual or potential infringement claim, including procuring rights for continued use of the products, replacing or modifying the alleged infringing portion of the products, or terminating the affected subscription term.

However, a gap in the agreement is the lack of specific requirements for corrective actions in response to other types of non-compliance, such as security incidents or data breaches. While Section 4.2 (Security Program) requires Atlassian to maintain an information security program, it does not specify the corrective actions that must be taken in the event of a security incident.

Furthermore, the agreement does not provide clear timelines for completing corrective actions, which may lead to delays or inconsistent implementation. For example, Section 12.3 (Termination for Cause) requires Atlassian to provide notice of termination, but it does not specify the timeframe for completing corrective actions before termination.

This gap may lead to uncertainty and potential disputes regarding subcontracting arrangements.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I suggest adding a clause that mandates prior approval from the financial entity before engaging subcontractors. The clause should specify the approval process, criteria, and timelines to ensure transparency and clarity. Here is a proposed clause:

""20.11.1 Prior Approval for Subcontracting: Atlassian must obtain prior written approval from [Financial Entity] before engaging any subcontractor to perform any obligations under this Agreement. The approval process will be as follows:

To ensure subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary provider, I recommend adding the following monitoring requirements:

* Regular audits: Atlassian must conduct regular audits of subcontractors to ensure they are meeting the required standards.
* Performance reviews: Atlassian must conduct regular performance reviews of subcontractors to assess their compliance with the Agreement and identify areas for improvement.
* Compliance checks: Atlassian must conduct regular compliance checks of subcontractors to ensure they are adhering to the Agreement and relevant laws and regulations.

While this section acknowledges the use of subcontractors, it does not outline a specific risk assessment process for evaluating the financial, operational, and compliance risks associated with these subcontractors. This absence is concerning, as it may leave Atlassian vulnerable to potential risks and non-compliance issues.

To address this gap, I strongly suggest adding a mandatory subcontractor risk assessment process as part of overall third-party risk management. This process should include criteria for assessing financial, operational, and compliance risks associated with subcontractors, such as:

20.11.2. Risk Assessment. The assessment shall consider the following factors:

* Number of subcontractors and their roles in the chain
* Dependencies between subcontractors and their impact on the overall performance of the Agreement
* Geographical dispersion of subcontractors and its impact on data protection, security, and regulatory compliance
* Operational risks associated with subcontracting chains, including communication, coordination, and quality control

20.11.3. Mitigation Measures. Based on the assessment, Atlassian shall implement mitigation measures to address identified risks, including:

* Establishing clear communication channels and protocols between subcontractors
* Implementing quality control and assurance processes to ensure subcontractor performance
* Conducting regular audits and reviews to monitor subcontractor compliance with regulatory requirements
* Developing contingency plans to address potential disruptions or failures in the subcontracting chain""

By adding these clauses, the contract will require Atlassian to conduct a thorough assessment of its subcontracting chain and implement measures to mitigate operational and regulatory risks, ensuring a more robust and compliant subcontracting arrangement."

However, I did not find any specific tools or processes described for ensuring compliance throughout the chain. To ensure that Atlassian can effectively monitor the subcontracting chain, I recommend including requirements for regular chain monitoring, such as reporting structures or dedicated monitoring resources.

For instance, Atlassian could be required to:

* Establish a regular reporting schedule with its subcontractors to ensure compliance with the Agreement
* Designate a specific point of contact for subcontractor management and compliance monitoring
* Implement a system for tracking and monitoring subcontractor performance and compliance
* Conduct regular audits or assessments of subcontractor compliance with the Agreement

By including these requirements, Atlassian can ensure that it has a robust system in place for monitoring the subcontracting chain and addressing any compliance issues that may arise. This will help to maintain the trust and confidence of its customers, such as the Customer, in the Agreement and the services provided."

Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, this section does not explicitly require Atlassian to disclose the names and roles of all subcontractors.

The section only mentions that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. This implies that Atlassian may have some level of transparency with its subcontractors, but it does not guarantee that the customer will have access to this information.

Regarding changes to the subcontracting structure, Section 20.11 does not explicitly require Atlassian to notify the customer of any changes. However, it does state that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement, which implies that any changes to the subcontracting structure may impact Atlassian's ability to meet its obligations.

Regarding the financial entity's right to access this information, Section 20.11 does not explicitly address this issue. However, it is worth noting that the customer is responsible for ensuring that they have the necessary rights and permissions to access the information they need to fulfill their obligations under the Agreement.

In summary, the contract does not require Atlassian to disclose the names and roles of all subcontractors, nor does it explicitly require Atlassian to notify the customer of changes to the subcontracting structure. I would recommend adding clauses mandating full disclosure of subcontracting chains to ensure transparency and accountability in the subcontracting process.

**Suggested Additions:**

1. Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) should be amended to require Atlassian to disclose the names and roles of all subcontractors, including any changes to the subcontracting structure.
2. A new clause should be added to require Atlassian to notify the customer of any changes to the subcontracting structure, including the names and roles of new subcontractors.
3. A new clause should be added to require Atlassian to provide the customer with access to information about the subcontracting chain, including the names and roles of subcontractors, upon request.

**Example of Suggested Clause:**

""20.11.1 Atlassian shall disclose to the Customer the names and roles of all subcontractors, including any changes to the subcontracting structure. Atlassian shall provide the Customer with written notice of any changes to the subcontracting structure, including the names and roles of new subcontractors, within [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days].

20.11.2 Atlassian shall provide the Customer with access to information about the subcontracting chain, including the names and roles of subcontractors, upon request. The Customer shall have the right to request this information at any time during the term of this Agreement."""

**Notification Requirements for Changes**

Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any notification requirements for changes in the subcontracting chain.

**Re-assessment of Risks for New Subcontractors or Structural Changes**

Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) also states that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any process for re-assessing risks for new subcontractors or structural changes.

**Recommendations**

To ensure compliance with the requirements for evaluating changes in the subcontracting chain, I recommend including the following clauses in the contract:

* A provision requiring timely notification of any changes in the subcontracting structure, including the addition or removal of subcontractors or Affiliates.
* A provision requiring a re-assessment of risks for new subcontractors or structural changes, including an evaluation of the subcontractor's qualifications, experience, and performance history.
* A provision requiring Atlassian to obtain Customer's approval before making any changes to the subcontracting structure that may impact the performance of the Agreement.

These clauses will help ensure that Customer is informed and involved in any changes to the subcontracting structure, and that Atlassian takes steps to mitigate any risks associated with those changes."
"Search for clauses specifying restrictions or conditions for subcontracting. Extract details about limitations on services, geography, or critical functions.

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

This clause allows Atlassian to subcontract its services, but it does not specify any limitations on services, geography, or critical functions. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain control over critical functions, I recommend adding the following restrictions:

* **Limited services**: Specify the types of services that can be subcontracted, such as non-core functions or non-critical services.
* **Geographic limitations**: Restrict subcontracting to specific geographic regions or countries to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
* **Critical functions**: Identify critical functions that cannot be subcontracted, such as data processing, security, or customer support.

Example of revised clause:

**20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but only for non-core functions, such as infrastructure management or maintenance, and only within the European Union. Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. Critical functions, including data processing, security, and customer support, cannot be subcontracted.

By adding these restrictions, Atlassian can ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain control over critical functions, while still allowing for subcontracting of non-core services."

However, the provision does not explicitly require prior approval from the customer for subcontracting. To address this, I recommend including a requirement for prior approval from the customer for subcontracting. This can be achieved by adding a clause to Section 20.11 that requires Atlassian to obtain the customer's prior written approval before subcontracting any work or services.

Here is a suggested revised clause:

""20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates.

Prior to subcontracting any work or services, Atlassian shall obtain the Customer's prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Customer shall have the right to review and approve the subcontractor's qualifications, experience, and proposed scope of work before any subcontracting arrangement is entered into.""

This revised clause ensures that the customer has visibility and control over subcontracting arrangements and can approve or reject any proposed subcontractor before work commences. This can help to mitigate risks associated with subcontracting and ensure that the customer's interests are protected."
Locate terms requiring monitoring of subcontractors. Validate whether these include audits or compliance checks. Suggest adding monitoring requirements if missing.,"**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires Atlassian to maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures (Section 4.2).

**Monitoring of Subcontractors:** Section 20.11 of the Agreement states that Atlassian may use subcontractors in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not explicitly require Atlassian to monitor its subcontractors.

**Validation:** Upon reviewing the Agreement, I did not find any specific terms that require Atlassian to monitor its subcontractors, including audits or compliance checks. This is a potential compliance risk, as subcontractors may not adhere to the same standards as Atlassian.

**Suggested Addition:** To mitigate this risk, I recommend adding a term to the Agreement that requires Atlassian to monitor its subcontractors, including audits or compliance checks. This could be achieved by adding a new section, such as:

""20.11.1 Subcontractor Monitoring: Atlassian shall maintain a system to monitor its subcontractors' compliance with this Agreement and its obligations. This shall include regular audits and compliance checks to ensure that subcontractors are meeting the required standards. Atlassian shall provide Customer with access to the results of these audits and compliance checks upon request.""

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices, I recommend adding a risk evaluation process for subcontractors. This can be achieved by incorporating the following provisions:

*   **Risk Assessment Criteria:** Establish clear criteria for evaluating subcontractors, including:
    *   Technical capabilities and expertise
    *   Security measures and compliance with relevant regulations
    *   Financial stability and reputation
    *   Experience working with sensitive data
    *   Ability to meet customer requirements and expectations
*   **Scope of Risk Assessment:** Define the scope of the risk assessment to include:
    *   Review of subcontractor's security policies and procedures
    *   Evaluation of subcontractor's compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards
    *   Assessment of subcontractor's technical capabilities and expertise
    *   Review of subcontractor's financial stability and reputation
    *   Evaluation of subcontractor's experience working with sensitive data
*   **Risk Evaluation Process:** Establish a risk evaluation process that includes:
    *   Identification of potential risks and threats
    *   Assessment of the likelihood and impact of each risk
    *   Development of mitigation strategies to address identified risks
    *   Regular review and update of the risk assessment to ensure ongoing compliance

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that subcontractors are thoroughly evaluated and selected based on their ability to meet customer requirements and expectations. This will help to maintain the security and integrity of customer data and ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices."

This Agreement requires a thorough evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and mitigate potential risks. Specifically, clauses 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) and 20.11(b) (Assignment) necessitate an assessment of the subcontracting chain's complexity.

**Clause 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

**Clause 20.11(b): Assignment**

Any attempt by Customer to transfer or assign this Agreement or an Order, except as expressly authorized above, will be null and void.

**References to Subcontractor Numbers or Geographical Dispersion**

Unfortunately, there are no explicit references to the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion in these clauses. However, it is essential to consider these factors to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

**Suggested Addition**

To address this gap, I recommend adding a requirement to evaluate the length and complexity of subcontracting chains, including the number of subcontractors and geographical dispersion. This can be achieved by inserting a new clause, such as:

**Clause 20.11(c): Subcontracting Chain Evaluation**

Atlassian shall evaluate the length and complexity of its subcontracting chain, including the number of subcontractors and geographical dispersion, to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Atlassian shall provide Customer with information on its subcontracting chain, including the names and locations of subcontractors, upon request.

By incorporating this requirement, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to transparency and compliance, and Customer can better understand the risks associated with the subcontracting chain."
"Search for provisions assessing the provider's ability to monitor subcontracting chains. Extract details of tools or processes mentioned. If missing, recommend including monitoring mechanisms.","**Compliance Assessment: Monitoring Subcontracting Chains**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the provider has not explicitly included provisions to assess its ability to monitor subcontracting chains. This is a critical compliance requirement, as it ensures that the provider can maintain control over the quality and security of its services, even when subcontracting to third-party vendors.

**Recommendation:**

To address this compliance gap, Atlassian should consider including provisions that assess its ability to monitor subcontracting chains. This can be achieved by:

1. **Defining subcontracting requirements**: Specify the conditions under which subcontracting is allowed, including the types of services that can be subcontracted, the selection process for subcontractors, and the requirements for subcontractor performance.
2. **Establishing monitoring mechanisms**: Implement tools or processes to monitor subcontracting chains, such as:
	* Regular audits and assessments of subcontractors' performance and compliance with Atlassian's standards.
	* Implementation of a subcontractor management system to track subcontractor activities, including their scope of work, timelines, and deliverables.
	* Use of data analytics and machine learning to identify potential risks or non-compliance in subcontracting chains.
3. **Providing transparency and accountability**: Ensure that subcontractors are aware of their responsibilities and obligations, and that they are held accountable for their performance.
4. **Regularly reviewing and updating subcontracting policies**: Periodically review and update subcontracting policies to ensure they remain effective and compliant with relevant laws and regulations.

**Tools or processes to consider:**

1. **Subcontractor management software**: Utilize software solutions that enable the management of subcontractors, including tracking their performance, compliance, and deliverables.
2. **Risk assessment and mitigation tools**: Implement tools that help identify and mitigate risks associated with subcontracting chains, such as data breaches or non-compliance with regulations.
3. **Auditing and compliance tools**: Use tools that facilitate regular audits and assessments of subcontractors' performance and compliance with Atlassian's standards.
4. **Data analytics and machine learning**: Leverage data analytics and machine learning to identify potential risks or non-compliance in subcontracting chains.

By incorporating these provisions and tools, Atlassian can ensure that its subcontracting chains are monitored effectively, and that it maintains compliance with relevant laws and regulations."
