"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I have found no explicit mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. This absence is noted as a gap in the contract.

However, I did find a clause in Section 6.2 that mentions the responsibility of the customer to determine whether the products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use. This clause implies that the customer is responsible for assessing the suitability of the products, but it does not specifically address the substitutability of the provider.

To address this gap, I recommend including provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and defining criteria for determining substitutability. This could be achieved by adding a new clause, such as:

""6.3. Substitutability Assessment: The parties agree to conduct a substitutability assessment of the provider at regular intervals (e.g., every 12 months) to determine whether the provider is easily substitutable. The assessment criteria shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

* The provider's ability to meet the customer's changing needs and requirements
* The provider's technical compatibility with the customer's existing systems and infrastructure
* The provider's level of innovation and ability to adapt to new technologies
* The provider's financial stability and ability to meet its obligations
* The provider's reputation and track record of service delivery

The results of the substitutability assessment shall be documented and shared with both parties. If the assessment indicates that the provider is not easily substitutable, the parties shall discuss and agree on a plan to address any concerns and ensure the continued delivery of services.""

This proposed clause would provide a framework for assessing the substitutability of the provider and would help to ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the provider's capabilities and limitations."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. While the contract mentions the use of third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products (Section 7.2, Third-Party Products), it does not provide clear guidelines for assessing substitutability.

To address this, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

1. Cost: Establish a clear methodology for calculating the total cost of ownership (TCO) for each product or service, including upfront costs, maintenance fees, and any additional expenses.
2. Technical specifications: Define the technical requirements for substitutability, including compatibility with existing infrastructure, scalability, and security standards.
3. Ease of transition: Develop a framework for evaluating the ease of transitioning from one product or service to another, including factors such as data migration, user training, and system integration.

Industry standards, such as the following, could serve as benchmarks for these criteria:

* Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) framework by Gartner
* Technical compatibility guidelines by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
* Operational complexity assessment methodology by the Project Management Institute (PMI)

By incorporating these criteria, Atlassian can provide customers with a more transparent and measurable approach to evaluating substitutability, enabling them to make informed decisions about their product and service choices."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","After reviewing the contract, I have found the following clauses related to documentation of alternative providers in the market:

* Section 7.2 states that ""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace ('Third-Party Products').""
* Section 7.2 also mentions that ""Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement.""

However, I did not find any specific requirements for documenting alternative providers in the market. The contract does not mention anything about maintaining a list of alternative providers or conducting regular market scans to identify and document them.

**Missing documentation requirements:**

* There is no requirement for Customer to document alternative providers in the market.
* There is no requirement for Atlassian to maintain a list of alternative providers or conduct regular market scans to identify and document them.
* Section 7.2 only mentions that Customer may choose to use Third-Party Products, but it does not require Customer to document these alternatives.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This would ensure that Customer and Atlassian are aware of the market alternatives and can make informed decisions about their use of the Products and Third-Party Products. The recommended clause could be added to Section 7.2, for example:

""Customer shall conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers of Third-Party Products. Customer shall provide Atlassian with a list of these alternative providers on a quarterly basis, or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties.""

This clause would ensure that Customer and Atlassian have visibility into the market alternatives and can make informed decisions about their use of the Products and Third-Party Products."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that requires a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers, specifically in Section 10.1 (Fees). This section states that Atlassian may specify that modifications will become effective during a then-current Subscription Term if required to address compliance with Law, or required to reflect updates to Product functionality or introduction of new Product features. If Customer objects, Customer may terminate the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term for the affected Products as its exclusive remedy.

However, I have not found any explicit provisions that require a regular cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers to maintain strategic flexibility. The Agreement primarily focuses on the terms and conditions of the Atlassian products and services, rather than strategic planning or cost-benefit analysis.

I would suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility. This could be achieved by incorporating a clause that requires Customer to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers on a periodic basis, such as annually or bi-annually. The analysis should consider financial, operational, and strategic factors, including:

* Financial factors: cost savings, revenue growth, return on investment (ROI)
* Operational factors: integration with existing systems, scalability, reliability
* Strategic factors: alignment with business goals, competitive advantage, innovation

This would enable Customer to maintain strategic flexibility and make informed decisions about their Atlassian product and service usage, ensuring they remain aligned with their business objectives and goals."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks explicit provisions requiring the customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives, which is a critical aspect of compliance with certain regulatory requirements.

**Clause Analysis:** Upon reviewing the agreement, I did not find any clauses that specifically require the customer to conduct periodic market research or maintain awareness of market alternatives.

**Provision Extraction:** There are no provisions that explicitly mention the need to conduct periodic market reviews or evaluate emerging alternatives.

**Validation:** To validate this observation, I reviewed the agreement's sections on ""Customer Obligations"" (Section 6) and ""General Terms"" (Section 20), but neither section includes provisions related to market research or awareness of market alternatives.

**Recommendation:** Given the absence of these provisions, I recommend adding a clause that requires the customer to conduct periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. This would help ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and allow Atlassian to stay competitive in the market.

**Proposed Provision:** Consider adding the following provision to the agreement:

""6.5 Market Awareness: Customer shall maintain awareness of market alternatives and emerging technologies through periodic market research and reviews. Customer shall provide Atlassian with written notice of any significant changes in the market or emergence of new technologies that may impact the Products or Services.""

This proposed provision would require the customer to conduct regular market research and reviews to stay informed about market alternatives and emerging technologies."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there is a requirement to assess existing arrangements with the same provider, specifically in Section 5.2. License Verification, which states that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.

However, this audit is limited to verifying compliance with the Scope of Use, and does not explicitly require a comprehensive review of the existing arrangements, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements.

To address this gap, it is recommended to include a periodic review of all existing contracts with the provider, as follows:

* Section 5.2. License Verification: Add a clause to require a comprehensive review of existing arrangements, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements, in addition to verifying compliance with the Scope of Use.

Example:

""Customer must provide Atlassian with a comprehensive review of all existing contracts with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements, at the time of each audit. This review must include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the existing contracts to ensure that they are in compliance with this Agreement and the applicable Product-Specific Terms.""

This revised clause would ensure that Customer is required to conduct a thorough review of their existing arrangements with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements, in addition to verifying compliance with the Scope of Use."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that requires the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers, specifically in Section 7.2 ""Third-Party Products"". This section states that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products"").

However, I have not found any explicit requirements in the contract for Customer to evaluate or document risks associated with these connected providers. The contract only mentions that Customer's use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider's terms of use, not this Agreement, and that Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.

I recommend flagging this absence and suggesting that the contract include requirements for Customer to evaluate and document risks from connected providers. This could include provisions such as:

* Requiring Customer to conduct a risk assessment of Third-Party Products before using them with the Products
* Requiring Customer to document any risks associated with Third-Party Products and how they will be mitigated
* Requiring Atlassian to provide guidance on how to evaluate and manage risks from connected providers

Including these provisions would help to ensure that Customer is aware of the potential risks associated with using connected providers and can take steps to mitigate them, which would be in compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","Compliance Review: Concentration Risk Evaluation

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is evident that the contract does not explicitly mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. However, Section 20.13, ""Export Restrictions,"" does require Customer to comply with applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products.

Moreover, Section 20.11, ""Subcontractors and Affiliates,"" states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

While these sections do not explicitly address concentration risk, they do highlight the importance of understanding the dependencies and relationships between Atlassian's services and its subcontractors or Affiliates. However, a more comprehensive analysis of concentration risk is not explicitly required by the contract.

Recommendation:
To address this compliance gap, I recommend adding a section to the contract that requires Atlassian to evaluate and mitigate concentration risks associated with relying on a single provider for multiple services. This could include:

* Identifying critical dependencies on Atlassian for multiple services
* Assessing the potential impact of a service disruption or failure on the overall business
* Developing strategies to mitigate concentration risks, such as diversifying suppliers or services
* Regularly reviewing and updating the concentration risk assessment to ensure ongoing compliance with this requirement

By incorporating this section, the contract would provide a more comprehensive framework for managing concentration risks and ensuring that Atlassian takes proactive steps to mitigate these risks."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that addresses the interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Specifically, Section 7.2 ""Third-Party Products"" states:

""Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.""

This provision acknowledges the potential interdependencies between the Atlassian Products and Third-Party Products, but it does not explicitly assess the operational risks associated with these interdependencies.

To address this gap, I suggest adding a clause that requires an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This could be included in the Agreement as follows:

""7.2.1 Assessment of Interdependencies: Atlassian and Customer will jointly assess the potential interdependencies between the Atlassian Products and Third-Party Products, including the potential risks and impacts on operational continuity. This assessment will be conducted at the time of onboarding Third-Party Products and updated as necessary to reflect changes to the Third-Party Products or the Atlassian Products. The results of this assessment will be documented and made available to both parties.""

This additional clause would require Atlassian and Customer to collaborate on assessing the potential interdependencies between the Atlassian Products and Third-Party Products, and to document the results of this assessment. This would help to ensure that both parties are aware of the potential operational risks associated with these interdependencies and can take steps to mitigate them."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that may be relevant to evaluating the provider's market share and concentration risk:

* Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, which may imply a level of control or dominance by Atlassian in the market.
* Section 20.14 (Government End-Users) notes that the Agreement is subject to the Government Amendment, which may indicate that Atlassian has a significant presence in the market and is subject to government regulations.
* Section 10.1 (Fees) states that Atlassian may charge fees for the Products, Support, and Advisory Services, which may indicate a level of market dominance or control by Atlassian.

However, I have not found any explicit clauses that assess the provider's market share and concentration risk, such as:

* A clause that requires Atlassian to disclose its market share or concentration risk to the customer.
* A clause that outlines the customer's rights and remedies in the event of a monopoly or limited alternatives.
* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide a level of service or support that ensures the customer's business continuity in the event of a market disruption.

To address this gap, I recommend adding terms to the Agreement that require Atlassian to:

* Disclose its market share and concentration risk to the customer.
* Provide a level of service or support that ensures the customer's business continuity in the event of a market disruption.
* Outline the customer's rights and remedies in the event of a monopoly or limited alternatives.

For example, the following clause could be added:

""20.16 Market Concentration Risk

Atlassian acknowledges that its market share and concentration risk may impact the customer's business continuity. To mitigate this risk, Atlassian agrees to:

* Disclose its market share and concentration risk to the customer upon request.
* Provide a level of service or support that ensures the customer's business continuity in the event of a market disruption.
* Outline the customer's rights and remedies in the event of a monopoly or limited alternatives.

This clause would require Atlassian to take steps to mitigate the concentration risk and provide the customer with transparency and support in the event of a market disruption."""
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. The contract does not address location-specific factors such as infrastructure reliability or natural disasters that could impact the provider's operations.

However, the contract does contain a clause (Section 20.4) that governs the governing law, jurisdiction, and venue for disputes related to the agreement. Specifically, it states that:

""If Customer is domiciled: (i) in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland, with the jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement in the courts of the Republic of Ireland, or (ii) elsewhere, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, with the jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement in the state and United States federal courts located in San Francisco, California.""

This clause suggests that the provider has considered the geographical location of the customer and has established a governing law and jurisdiction that may impact the provider's operations in different regions. However, this does not necessarily address geographical concentration risks related to location-specific factors.

To address this gap, I recommend that the contract include a provision that requires the provider to conduct a geographical risk assessment and to disclose any risks associated with location-specific factors that could impact the provider's operations. This would include, but not be limited to, infrastructure reliability, natural disasters, and other location-specific risks that could impact the provider's ability to deliver its services."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to data protection and third-country providers:

**Clause 4.2: Security Program**

Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures.

This clause requires Atlassian to implement a robust security program to protect Customer Data, but it does not explicitly mention compliance with EU data protection regulations.

**Clause 4.3: Data Retrieval**

The Documentation describes how Customer may retrieve its Customer Data from the Cloud Products.

This clause does not contain any specific requirements for third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations.

**Clause 4.5: Removals and Suspension**

Atlassian may remove or suspend access to Customer Data if it becomes aware that such data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others, including relating to a takedown request received following the guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations.

This clause does not explicitly mention EU data protection regulations, but it does require Atlassian to comply with applicable laws, which may include EU data protection laws.

**Clause 6.1: Disclosures and Rights**

Customer must ensure it has made all disclosures and obtained all rights and consents necessary for Atlassian to use Customer Data and Customer Materials to provide the Cloud Products, Support or Advisory Services.

This clause does not specifically require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations.

**Clause 16: Confidentiality**

This clause requires both parties to maintain confidentiality of each other's Confidential Information, including Customer Data.

However, this clause does not explicitly require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations.

**Clause 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.

This clause requires Atlassian to comply with applicable laws, including EU data protection laws, but it does not explicitly mention EU data protection regulations.

**Validation**

While the Atlassian Customer Agreement contains some provisions related to data protection, it does not explicitly require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To ensure compliance with EU data protection laws, I recommend including a clause that explicitly requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations.

**Recommendation**

Consider adding a clause that explicitly requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, such as:

""Third-country providers must comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable EU data protection laws when processing Customer Data.""

This clause would ensure that third-country providers are aware of their obligations to comply with EU data protection regulations and would help to ensure the protection of Customer Data."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several clauses that assess the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, particularly in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.

The agreement explicitly states that it is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of the State of California if the customer is domiciled elsewhere (Section 20.4). This indicates that the provider has considered the jurisdictional laws that may impact contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.

Furthermore, the agreement includes a provision for termination for cause, which allows either party to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to cure a material breach of the agreement, including a failure to pay fees (Section 12.3). This provision suggests that the provider has considered the importance of ensuring timely payment and compliance with contractual obligations.

Additionally, the agreement includes a clause on compliance with laws, which requires each party to comply with all applicable laws in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under the agreement (Section 20.1). This provision demonstrates the provider's commitment to regulatory compliance and its expectation that customers will also adhere to relevant laws and regulations.

However, to further mitigate legal risks, I recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider's country. This could include:

* A clause requiring the provider to conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential legal risks and regulatory compliance issues in its jurisdiction
* A provision for the provider to maintain a robust compliance program, including policies, procedures, and training for employees to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations
* A clause requiring the provider to notify customers of any changes to laws or regulations that may impact the agreement or the provider's compliance obligations
* A provision for the provider to cooperate with customers to resolve any disputes or issues arising from non-compliance with laws or regulations.

By incorporating these provisions, the agreement can better ensure that the provider is taking proactive steps to mitigate legal risks and ensure regulatory compliance in its jurisdiction."

Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there are no explicit clauses addressing data localization requirements. However, there are provisions related to data processing and storage that may be relevant to data localization concerns.

**Extracted Terms:**

* **Data Processing:** Section 4.1 of the Agreement states that Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with the Agreement.
* **Data Storage:** Section 4.2 of the Agreement mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
* **Data Transfer:** Section 4.5 of the Agreement allows Atlassian to transfer Customer Data to third-party service providers or subprocessors, subject to certain conditions.
* **Customer Data:** Section 16.1 of the Agreement defines Customer Data as information disclosed by Customer to Atlassian under or in connection with the Agreement.

**Associated Risks:**

The lack of explicit data localization provisions in the Agreement may expose Customer to risks associated with data transfer and storage across third-country jurisdictions. These risks include:

* Non-compliance with local data protection regulations
* Unauthorized access or disclosure of Customer Data
* Breach of data localization requirements
* Negative impact on Customer's business operations and reputation

**Recommendation:**

To address these risks and ensure compliance with regulatory and operational needs, it is suggested that the Agreement be amended to include explicit data localization provisions. These provisions should specify the countries where Customer Data will be stored, the measures taken to protect data, and the procedures for transferring data to third-party service providers or subprocessors."
"Search for provisions assessing country-specific operational risks (e.g., political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues). Highlight gaps in the contract if such assessments are not required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified that the contract does not explicitly assess country-specific operational risks. This is a significant gap in the contract, as it may expose Atlassian to unforeseen risks in certain countries.

Section 20.4 of the contract specifies that the agreement will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of California, USA, if the customer is domiciled elsewhere. However, this provision does not address potential country-specific risks such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues that may impact Atlassian's operations in these countries.

To mitigate this risk, I recommend adding a provision that requires Atlassian to evaluate country-specific operational risks before providing services to customers in specific countries. This evaluation should take into account factors such as:

* Political stability and potential for unrest
* Legal framework and potential for changes to laws or regulations
* Infrastructure and potential for disruptions or outages
* Local business practices and potential for cultural or language barriers

By including such a provision, Atlassian can better assess the risks associated with operating in specific countries and take steps to mitigate them, ensuring that the company can provide reliable services to its customers worldwide.

Recommendation:

* Add a provision to the contract that requires Atlassian to evaluate country-specific operational risks before providing services to customers in specific countries.
* Specify the factors to be considered in the evaluation, such as political stability, legal framework, infrastructure, and local business practices.
* Require Atlassian to provide a written assessment of the risks and mitigation strategies to the customer before commencing services in a specific country.

By implementing this recommendation, Atlassian can better manage country-specific operational risks and provide a more reliable service to its customers worldwide."

The relevant provision is as follows:

""Upon Atlassian’s written request, Customer will promptly confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer’s use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer’s Scope of Use, provided Atlassian gives Customer reasonable advance notice and uses reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Customer.""

While this provision allows for audits to confirm compliance with the Scope of Use, it does not specifically require critical risk assessments. I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.

Here is a suggested addition to the contract:

""Critical Risk Assessments: Atlassian and Customer will jointly conduct regular critical risk assessments of the ICT third-party provider on a schedule to be determined by both parties, but in any event, not less than annually. These assessments will identify and mitigate any critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider that could impact the operation of the Products. The results of these assessments will be documented and shared with both parties.""

This clause would require regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider, which would help maintain operational resilience and ensure that any potential risks are identified and mitigated."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","After reviewing the contract, I can confirm that there is a section on ""Force Majeure"" (Section 20.10) that addresses risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments.

However, this section does not specify explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as contingency plans, redundancies, or alternative providers. It only acknowledges that neither party is liable for certain events that may occur, but it does not outline any specific actions that would be taken to mitigate the risks associated with those events.

To address this gap, I suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. This could include:

* Identifying critical risks and outlining specific mitigation strategies for each risk
* Developing contingency plans for potential disruptions or failures
* Establishing redundancies or backup systems to ensure business continuity
* Identifying alternative providers or suppliers to mitigate supply chain risks

By incorporating these measures, the contract can provide a more comprehensive framework for managing risk and ensuring business continuity in the event of unforeseen events."

The agreement does not explicitly specify monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements. However, it does mention the Security Measures, which outline Atlassian's security practices, including its information security program and compliance program. Additionally, the agreement references the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Cloud Products, which may include service availability and response time metrics.

To address the recommendation, I suggest including provisions for continuous monitoring in the agreement. This could involve specifying tools or metrics to be used for monitoring, such as:

* Service availability and uptime
* Response times for support requests
* Security incident response and management
* Compliance with relevant laws and regulations

The agreement could also specify the frequency of monitoring, such as:

* Quarterly or bi-annual reviews of security and compliance metrics
* Regular audits of Atlassian's security and compliance practices
* Real-time monitoring of service availability and response times

Furthermore, the agreement could require Atlassian to provide regular reporting on its performance and operations, including:

* Quarterly or annual reports on security and compliance metrics
* Regular updates on any security incidents or breaches
* Notification of any changes to Atlassian's security or compliance practices

By including these provisions, the agreement can ensure that Atlassian is held accountable for its performance and operations, and that risks related to its performance and operations are continuously monitored and addressed."

**Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the contract, I found that Section 20.10, ""Force Majeure,"" mentions that neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the contract due to events beyond its reasonable control and occurring without that party's fault or negligence. However, this provision does not constitute a specific mitigation measure for critical risks.

Additionally, Section 15.4, ""Mitigation,"" states that in response to an actual or potential infringement claim, Atlassian may, at its option, procure rights for Customer's continued use of the Products, replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Products without reducing the overall functionality of the Products, or terminate the affected Subscription Term and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term. While this section does mention some potential mitigation measures, it is limited to intellectual property infringement claims and does not address other critical risks.

**Gap Identification:**

Given the absence of explicit references to contingency plans or predefined responses for critical risks, I flag this as a gap in the contract. It is essential for contracts to include specific mitigation measures and contingency plans to address potential risks and ensure business continuity.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, the contract should be revised to include specific mitigation measures for critical risks identified in assessments, such as:

1. A clear description of contingency plans for critical risks, including procedures for notification, escalation, and response.
2. Predefined responses for specific risk scenarios, including communication protocols and decision-making processes.
3. Regular review and update of the contract to reflect changes in risk assessments and mitigation measures.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several terms that address the risk of technological lock-in, including reliance on proprietary software and long-term contractual exclusivity. However, some clauses could be strengthened to provide more flexibility and mitigate potential risks.

**Proprietary Software**

Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that Customer must not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Products. While this clause protects Atlassian's intellectual property, it may create a risk of technological lock-in for Customer.

**Contractual Exclusivity**

Section 10.1 (Fees) states that Customer's payment obligations under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. This clause creates a long-term contractual commitment, which may limit Customer's ability to exit the agreement if Atlassian's Products no longer meet their needs.

**Exit Strategies**

To mitigate the risk of technological lock-in, I recommend adding exit strategies to the agreement, such as:

1. **Right to Terminate**: Allow Customer to terminate the agreement with a reasonable notice period (e.g., 30 days) in case they decide to switch to a competing product or service.
2. **Data Portability**: Specify that Customer has the right to export their data in a standard format, making it easier to migrate to a different platform.
3. **Transition Period**: Establish a transition period during which Atlassian will continue to provide support and maintenance for the Products, allowing Customer to gradually transition to a new platform.
4. **Non-Exclusivity**: Consider adding a non-exclusivity clause, which would allow Customer to use competing products or services without violating the agreement.

**Suggested Amendments**

To address these concerns, I suggest the following amendments to the agreement:

1. Add a right to terminate clause, allowing Customer to exit the agreement with a reasonable notice period.
2. Include a data portability clause, specifying that Customer has the right to export their data in a standard format.
3. Establish a transition period during which Atlassian will continue to provide support and maintenance for the Products.
4. Consider adding a non-exclusivity clause, allowing Customer to use competing products or services without violating the agreement.

* Section 8, ""Support and Advisory Services,"" mentions that Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies. However, it does not specify any escalation procedures.
* Section 12, ""Term and Termination,"" outlines the termination procedures for the contract, but it does not address incident escalation.
* Section 15, ""Indemnification by Atlassian,"" discusses Atlassian's obligations to defend Customer against third-party claims, but it does not cover incident escalation.

To address the missing escalation procedures, I recommend adding an escalation matrix with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines for each escalation stage. This will ensure that both parties have a clear understanding of the incident escalation process and can respond accordingly.

**Proposed Escalation Matrix:**

1. **Initial Response (0-2 hours)**:
	* Roles: Atlassian Support Team
	* Responsibilities: Respond to incident reports, provide initial troubleshooting, and attempt to resolve the issue.
	* Timelines: Respond within 2 hours, resolve the issue within 4 hours.
2. **Escalation to Senior Support (2-24 hours)**:
	* Roles: Senior Support Engineer
	* Responsibilities: Take over the incident, perform more in-depth troubleshooting, and escalate to higher management if necessary.
	* Timelines: Respond within 2 hours, resolve the issue within 24 hours.
3. **Escalation to Technical Lead (24-72 hours)**:
	* Roles: Technical Lead
	* Responsibilities: Investigate the incident, identify the root cause, and develop a plan to prevent similar incidents in the future.
	* Timelines: Respond within 24 hours, resolve the issue within 72 hours.
4. **Escalation to Management (beyond 72 hours)**:
	* Roles: Management
	* Responsibilities: Oversee the incident resolution process, ensure that the issue is addressed, and provide updates to the customer.
	* Timelines: Respond within 24 hours, resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe.

This proposed escalation matrix provides a clear hierarchy and communication protocol for escalating incidents to higher management or relevant stakeholders. It ensures that both parties are aware of their roles and responsibilities and can respond accordingly to minimize downtime and ensure prompt resolution of issues."

Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including terms requiring a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to incident response and root cause analysis:

**Section 5.1: Modifications**

Atlassian may provide some portions of the Software Products in source code form for Customer to use internally to create bug fixes, configurations or other modifications of the Software Products. Customer must keep such source code secure, confidential, and only make it available to Customer's employees who have a legitimate need to access and use the source code to create and maintain Modifications.

**Section 5.2: License Verification**

Upon Atlassian's written request, Customer will promptly confirm in writing whether its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use. Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.

**Section 12.4: Effect of Termination**

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or a Subscription Term: (a) Customer's rights to use the applicable Products, Support or Advisory Services will cease, (b) Customer must immediately cease accessing the Cloud Products and using the applicable Software Products and Cloud Clients, and (c) Customer must delete (or, on request, return) all license keys, access keys and any Product copies.

While these clauses mention audit and verification of Customer's use of the Software Products, they do not explicitly mandate a root cause analysis following an incident. However, Section 5.2 implies that Atlassian may investigate and audit Customer's use of the Software Products, which could potentially involve identifying the root cause of an incident.

To address the recommendation, I suggest including a clause that requires a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability. This could be added to Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) or a new section specifically addressing incident response and root cause analysis.

**Recommended Clause:**

12.5: Incident Response and Root Cause Analysis

In the event of an incident affecting the Products, Support or Advisory Services, Customer must cooperate with Atlassian to conduct a thorough root cause analysis. This analysis must be completed within [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days] of the incident and must include a detailed report of the findings. Customer must share the report with Atlassian, which will review and discuss the findings with Customer. The report must include:

* A description of the incident
* The root cause of the incident
* Recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future
* Any necessary corrective actions to be taken by Customer

By including this clause, Atlassian can ensure that Customer takes a proactive and transparent approach to incident response and root cause analysis, which will help to maintain the integrity and security of the Products and Support or Advisory Services."
"Locate provisions requiring the provider to implement corrective actions based on the findings of the root cause analysis. Verify if the contract specifies a timeline and scope for these corrective measures.

Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including a clause mandating timely implementation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions that require the provider to implement corrective actions based on the findings of the root cause analysis. Specifically, Section 11.2 (Performance Warranty Remedy) states that if Atlassian breaches a Performance Warranty, it will use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity. Additionally, Section 15.4 (Mitigation) outlines Atlassian's obligations in response to an actual or potential Infringement Claim, which includes procuring rights for Customer's continued use of the Products, replacing or modifying the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminating the affected Subscription Term.

However, I did not find a specific timeline or scope for these corrective measures. While Section 11.2 mentions that Atlassian will use ""reasonable efforts"" to correct the non-conformity, it does not provide a specific timeframe or scope for the corrective actions.

To strengthen the contract, I suggest including a clause that mandates timely implementation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents. This could be achieved by adding a provision that requires Atlassian to implement corrective measures within a specified timeframe (e.g., 30 days) and to provide regular updates to Customer on the progress of the corrective actions. The clause could also specify the scope of the corrective measures, including any necessary changes to the Products, processes, or procedures.

Example of a suggested clause:

""In the event of a breach of a Performance Warranty or an Infringement Claim, Atlassian shall implement corrective measures within 30 days of the breach. Atlassian shall provide regular updates to Customer on the progress of the corrective actions and shall ensure that the corrective measures are completed within a reasonable timeframe. The scope of the corrective measures shall include, but not be limited to, any necessary changes to the Products, processes, or procedures to prevent recurrence of the incident.""

By including this clause, the contract can provide greater assurance to Customer that Atlassian will take timely and effective corrective actions to address any issues that arise, and that the provider will take steps to prevent recurrence of similar incidents in the future."
"BCDR Compliance:Search for clauses ensuring BCDR plans comply with DORA. Extract details on operational resilience measures for critical functions.

**Extracted Clauses:**

1. **BCDR Obligations:** Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that customers must not interfere with or circumvent product usage limits or scope of use restrictions, implying a need for BCDR plans to ensure continuity of operations.
2. **Data Protection:** Section 4.2 (Security Program) requires Atlassian to maintain an information security program that protects customer data, including measures for business continuity and disaster recovery.
3. **Operational Resilience:** Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires customers to comply with all applicable laws, including those related to operational resilience.

**Operational Resilience Measures:**

1. **Critical Function Identification:** The ACA does not explicitly require customers to identify critical functions, but Section 2.1 (Permitted Use) implies that customers should prioritize the continuity of essential operations.
2. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation:** Section 2.2 (Restrictions) suggests that customers should assess and mitigate risks to their operations, including those related to BCDR.
3. **BCDR Planning and Testing:** The ACA does not explicitly require customers to develop and test BCDR plans, but Section 2.2 (Restrictions) implies that customers should have plans in place to ensure continuity of operations.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Add a Compliance Clause:** Consider adding a clause to the ACA that explicitly requires customers to implement BCDR plans that comply with DORA, including measures for operational resilience.
2. **BCDR Planning and Testing:** Recommend that customers develop and test BCDR plans to ensure continuity of operations, including critical functions and risk mitigation strategies.
3. **Operational Resilience Measures:** Suggest that customers implement operational resilience measures, such as identifying critical functions, conducting risk assessments, and developing BCDR plans that address potential disruptions.

* Section 4.2 (Security Program) states that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, this clause does not explicitly mention RTOs or RPOs.
* Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension) mentions that Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products if Atlassian becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others. This clause does not specify any RTOs or RPOs for data recovery.
* Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. However, this clause does not specify any RTOs or RPOs for software recovery.

As these clauses do not explicitly mention RTOs or RPOs, I suggest defining these objectives in the contract to ensure clarity and measurability. Specifically, the contract should include the following:

* RTO: The time within which Atlassian will restore critical services after a disruption, such as data loss or system failure.
* RPO: The point in time to which data will be recovered in the event of a disruption.

To define these objectives, the contract could include the following language:

* ""Atlassian will maintain an RTO of [insert time period, e.g., 2 hours] for critical services, including [insert specific services, e.g., data storage and retrieval].""
* ""Atlassian will maintain an RPO of [insert time period, e.g., 1 hour] for critical data, including [insert specific data, e.g., customer information and transactional data].""

Upon reviewing the document, I found the following relevant sections:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) mentions that Customer must ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, which may include requirements for BCDR planning.
* Section 4.2 (Security Program) outlines Atlassian's information security program, which includes measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This implies that Atlassian may require Customer to have a BCDR plan in place to ensure business continuity.
* Section 10.3 (Return Policy) mentions that Customer may terminate the Subscription Term for a Product within 30 days of its initial Order, which suggests that Customer should have a BCDR plan in place to ensure business continuity during this period.

However, I did not find any explicit requirement for periodic updates to BCDR plans. To ensure compliance, I recommend adding a provision to update BCDR plans periodically or after operational changes. This can be achieved by:

* Adding a new section to the Agreement, e.g., Section 12.6 (BCDR Plan Updates), which requires Customer to update its BCDR plan periodically (e.g., annually) or after significant operational changes.
* Incorporating a BCDR plan update clause into the existing Section 2.2 (Restrictions) or Section 4.2 (Security Program) to ensure alignment with changing operational requirements.

**Recommendation:** Add a provision to update BCDR plans periodically or after operational changes to ensure compliance with changing operational requirements and ensure business continuity."
"Resilience Testing:Search for provisions requiring resilience testing of BCDR plans. Validate if testing frequency and scope are specified.

The Agreement does not specify the frequency or scope of testing for BCDR plans.

Section 4.2 of the Agreement mentions Atlassian's security program, which includes independent third-party audits and certifications. However, this provision does not directly address resilience testing.

To ensure the effectiveness of BCDR plans, I recommend adding mandatory testing clauses to the Agreement. This could include:

1. Regular testing frequency: Specify that BCDR plans must be tested at least annually, or more frequently if required by regulatory or industry standards.
2. Scope of testing: Define the scope of testing, including the types of scenarios that must be simulated, such as system failures, natural disasters, or cyber attacks.
3. Testing procedures: Outline the procedures for conducting resilience testing, including the involvement of relevant stakeholders, the use of testing tools and methodologies, and the documentation of test results.
4. Test results and reporting: Specify that test results must be documented and reported to relevant stakeholders, including Atlassian, and that any issues or vulnerabilities identified during testing must be addressed promptly.

By incorporating these provisions, the Agreement can ensure that BCDR plans are regularly tested and validated, reducing the risk of service disruptions and data loss."
Incident Reporting Timelines:Search for clauses specifying incident reporting timelines. Extract and confirm if timelines are aligned with regulatory standards. Flag gaps if timelines are not defined.,"Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I confirm that incident reporting timelines are specified in Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension) and Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification).

**Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension)**:
If Atlassian becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others, or if Customer's use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products. When practicable, Atlassian will give Customer the opportunity to remedy the issue before taking any such measures.

**Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification)**:
Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to notify Customer of any Infringement Claim and will give Customer the opportunity to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement of the Infringement Claim.

Incident reporting timelines are not explicitly defined in these sections. However, based on the language used, it appears that Atlassian aims to notify Customer of any potential issues or claims within a reasonable timeframe, allowing Customer to take corrective action.

Regulatory standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), require timely incident reporting to ensure prompt mitigation of potential risks and breaches.

To align with regulatory standards, I recommend adding specific incident reporting timelines to the Agreement, such as:

* Notifying Customer of potential issues or claims within 24 hours
* Providing a detailed incident report within 72 hours
* Cooperating with Customer to investigate and resolve the incident within a specified timeframe (e.g., 14 days)

By incorporating these timelines, Atlassian can ensure compliance with regulatory standards and maintain a robust incident response process."
"Escalation Procedures:Search for provisions defining escalation procedures for incidents. Extract details of roles, responsibilities, and communication paths.

The Agreement does not explicitly outline roles, responsibilities, and communication paths for incident escalation. However, it does mention that Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies (Section 8). This implies that Atlassian has a support process in place, but the specific escalation procedures are not clearly defined.

To address this compliance gap, I recommend including an escalation matrix in the Agreement. An escalation matrix would outline the steps to be taken when an incident occurs, including:

1. Initial response and communication with the customer
2. Roles and responsibilities for incident resolution
3. Communication paths and timelines for escalation
4. Escalation levels (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) and corresponding response times
5. Criteria for escalating incidents to higher levels

By including an escalation matrix, Atlassian can ensure that customers know what to expect in terms of response times and communication during incident resolution. This would enhance the overall customer experience and provide a clear framework for managing incidents.

**Recommendation:** Include an escalation matrix in the Agreement to outline roles, responsibilities, and communication paths for incident escalation. This would ensure that customers are aware of the escalation procedures and can expect timely and effective incident resolution."

**Corrective Action Requirements:** The Agreement does not specify the procedures or timelines for identifying and addressing root causes of issues, nor does it outline the scope of corrective actions required. This omission raises concerns about the effectiveness of Atlassian's quality management and continuous improvement processes.

**Gaps in Compliance:** The absence of clear corrective action requirements creates several gaps in compliance, including:

1. **Lack of Accountability:** Without specific provisions for corrective actions, Atlassian may not be held accountable for addressing root causes of issues, which can compromise the quality of its Products and Support and Advisory Services.
2. **Inadequate Timelines:** The Agreement does not establish timelines for identifying and addressing root causes, which can lead to delays in resolving issues and compromising customer satisfaction.
3. **Unclear Scope:** The absence of a clear scope for corrective actions may result in inconsistent or inadequate responses to issues, which can undermine the effectiveness of Atlassian's quality management processes.
4. **Insufficient Continuous Improvement:** Without a structured approach to corrective actions, Atlassian may not be able to identify and implement improvements to its Products and Support and Advisory Services, which can compromise customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Recommendations:** To address these gaps in compliance, Atlassian should consider revising the Agreement to include clear provisions for corrective actions based on root cause findings. This should include:

1. **Specific Timelines:** Establishing clear timelines for identifying and addressing root causes of issues.
2. **Clear Scope:** Defining the scope of corrective actions required to address root causes of issues.

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement. However, it does not explicitly mention the need for regular monitoring of the subcontracting chain.
* Section 20.11 also states that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under the Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under the Agreement. This suggests that Atlassian has some level of oversight over its subcontractors, but it is not clear if this oversight extends to regular monitoring of the subcontracting chain.

I recommend that Atlassian include requirements for regular chain monitoring, such as reporting structures or dedicated monitoring resources, to ensure compliance throughout the chain. This could include:

* Regular reporting on subcontractor performance and compliance with the Agreement
* Dedicated resources for monitoring subcontractor activities and ensuring compliance with the Agreement
* Clear procedures for investigating and addressing any issues or concerns related to subcontractor compliance

By including these requirements, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to ensuring compliance throughout the subcontracting chain and reduce the risk of non-compliance or reputational damage."

Follow-up if Missing:Highlight the lack of transparency provisions and suggest adding clauses mandating full disclosure of subcontracting chains.","**Compliance Observation: Lack of Transparency in Subcontracting Chains**

This contract fails to provide adequate transparency in subcontracting chains, which is a critical aspect of ensuring accountability and trust in business relationships. Specifically, the contract does not require the provider to disclose the names and roles of all subcontractors, nor does it mandate the disclosure of changes to the subcontracting structure.

**Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates)**

This section states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but it does not require the provider to disclose the names and roles of these subcontractors. This lack of transparency makes it challenging for the customer to verify the provider's compliance with the agreement and to identify potential risks associated with the subcontracting chain.

**Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) - Changes to Subcontracting Structure**

This section also fails to require the provider to disclose changes to the subcontracting structure, which is essential for maintaining transparency and accountability in the subcontracting chain.

**Validation of Financial Entity's Right to Access Information**

The contract does not explicitly state whether the financial entity has the right to access information about the subcontracting chain. This lack of clarity creates uncertainty and may hinder the financial entity's ability to exercise its rights under the agreement.

**Recommendation: Add Clauses Mandating Full Disclosure of Subcontracting Chains**

To address these compliance concerns, I recommend adding clauses to the contract that mandate full disclosure of subcontracting chains, including:

1. The names and roles of all subcontractors.
2. Changes to the subcontracting structure.
3. The financial entity's right to access information about the subcontracting chain.

These clauses will ensure transparency and accountability in the subcontracting chain, enabling the customer to verify the provider's compliance with the agreement and identify potential risks associated with the subcontracting chain."

Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including clauses for timely notification and risk evaluation of any changes in the subcontracting structure.","**Compliance Verification: Subcontracting Chain Evaluation**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is evident that there is a need for a process to evaluate changes in the subcontracting chain to ensure compliance with the contract terms. The agreement does not explicitly specify notification requirements for changes or re-assessment of risks for new subcontractors or structural changes.

**Missing Provisions:**

* The agreement does not mention notification requirements for changes in the subcontracting chain, which is a critical aspect of maintaining compliance.
* There is no provision for re-assessing risks for new subcontractors or structural changes, which could lead to unforeseen consequences if not properly evaluated.

**Recommended Clauses:**

To address these gaps, it is recommended that the contract includes clauses for timely notification and risk evaluation of any changes in the subcontracting structure. Specifically:

* The agreement should require subcontractors to notify Atlassian of any changes to their subcontracting chain, including the addition or removal of subcontractors, within a specified timeframe (e.g., 30 days).
* Atlassian should conduct a risk assessment for new subcontractors or structural changes, including an evaluation of their qualifications, experience, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
* The agreement should outline the process for re-assessing risks and notifying Atlassian of any changes, ensuring that the subcontracting chain remains compliant with the contract terms.

By including these clauses, the contract can ensure that changes in the subcontracting chain are properly evaluated and managed, reducing the risk of non-compliance and potential consequences."
"Search for clauses specifying restrictions or conditions for subcontracting. Extract details about limitations on services, geography, or critical functions. If missing, suggest adding these restrictions.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clause related to subcontracting:

Subcontractors and Affiliates: Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

This clause indicates that Atlassian may subcontract certain services, but it does not specify any limitations on the services that can be subcontracted, geography, or critical functions.

To strengthen this clause, I recommend adding the following details:

* Specify the types of services that cannot be subcontracted, such as critical functions, security-related services, or services that involve handling sensitive customer data.
* Limit subcontracting to specific geographic regions or countries, to ensure that sensitive customer data is handled and processed in accordance with local laws and regulations.
* Require subcontractors to adhere to the same standards and policies as Atlassian, including confidentiality, data protection, and security requirements.
* Specify the procedures for selecting and managing subcontractors, including due diligence, performance monitoring, and termination clauses.
* Consider adding a clause that requires Atlassian to obtain customer consent before subcontracting certain services or functions.

Here is an example of how the revised clause could look:

20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates: Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

However, Atlassian may not subcontract the following services:

* Critical functions, including but not limited to, security-related services, data backup and recovery, or disaster recovery services.
* Services that involve handling sensitive customer data, including but not limited to, personal identifiable information (PII), financial data, or confidential business information.
* Services that require Atlassian personnel to access customer premises or facilities.

Atlassian may subcontract services to subcontractors located in the following geographic regions:

* Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)
* Americas (North, Central, and South America)
* Asia Pacific (APAC)

Subcontractors must adhere to the same standards and policies as Atlassian, including confidentiality, data protection, and security requirements. Atlassian will conduct due diligence on subcontractors and will monitor their performance to ensure that they meet the required standards.

Customer consent is required for Atlassian to subcontract certain services or functions, which will be specified in the applicable Order Form.

By adding these details, the revised clause provides greater clarity and control over Atlassian's subcontracting practices, ensuring that customer data and interests are protected."

If absent, recommend including this requirement.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found that there is a provision requiring prior approval for subcontracting in Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates).

**Provision:**

""20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates. Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

**Details on the approval process:**

There is no specific detail on the approval process for subcontracting. However, it is mentioned that Atlassian will have ""appropriate written agreements"" in place with its subcontractors, which implies that some level of approval or review is required.

**Recommendation:**

I recommend including more specific details on the approval process for subcontracting to ensure clarity and transparency. This could include:

* A clear definition of what constitutes subcontracting
* A description of the types of subcontractors that may be used
* A detailed explanation of the approval process, including the roles and responsibilities of both parties
* A timeline for obtaining approval
* Any specific requirements for notification or documentation

By including these details, the agreement can provide a clear understanding of the subcontracting process and ensure that both parties are aware of their obligations and responsibilities.

**Example of revised provision:**

""20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates. Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement. Prior to engaging any subcontractor, Atlassian shall obtain written approval from Customer, which shall include:

* A detailed description of the subcontractor's role and responsibilities
* A copy of the subcontractor agreement, which shall include the subcontractor's obligations and liabilities
* A timeline for the subcontractor's engagement and expected completion date
* Any other information required by Customer to ensure compliance with this Agreement

Customer shall respond to Atlassian's request for approval within [insert timeframe, e.g. 5 business days] of receipt of the request. If approval is not granted, Atlassian shall not engage the subcontractor and shall identify alternative arrangements to meet its obligations under this Agreement."""
Locate terms requiring monitoring of subcontractors. Validate whether these include audits or compliance checks. Suggest adding monitoring requirements if missing.,"**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires Atlassian to maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures (Section 4.2).

**Validation:** Upon reviewing the Security Measures, it appears that Atlassian does not explicitly mention monitoring of subcontractors as part of its compliance program.

**Recommendation:** To strengthen compliance, I suggest adding a requirement for Atlassian to monitor its subcontractors, including audits or compliance checks, to ensure that they adhere to the same standards as Atlassian. This can be achieved by modifying Section 4.2 to include the following:

""4.2 Security Program. Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures. Additionally, Atlassian will monitor its subcontractors to ensure they adhere to the same standards as Atlassian, including regular audits and compliance checks.""

This revised language ensures that Atlassian takes a proactive approach to monitoring its subcontractors, thereby maintaining the integrity of its compliance program and protecting Customer Data."
"Search for provisions mandating risk assessments of subcontractors. Extract details on criteria and scope. If missing, recommend adding a risk evaluation process.","**Compliance Requirement:** As a Compliance Officer, it is essential to ensure that the organization assesses and mitigates risks associated with subcontractors. Section 20.11 of the Atlassian Customer Agreement highlights the importance of subcontractors in the performance of obligations under this Agreement.

**Provisions Mandating Risk Assessments of Subcontractors:**

* Section 20.11 states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not explicitly require a risk assessment of subcontractors.

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks, I recommend adding a risk evaluation process for subcontractors. This process should include:

* **Criteria for Risk Assessment:** Establish clear criteria for evaluating subcontractors, such as:
	+ Financial stability and reputation
	+ Technical expertise and capabilities
	+ Compliance with laws and regulations
	+ Security measures and data protection policies
	+ Business continuity and disaster recovery plans
* **Scope of Risk Assessment:** The risk assessment should cover the following aspects:
	+ Identification of potential risks and threats
	+ Evaluation of subcontractor's ability to manage and mitigate risks
	+ Review of subcontractor's compliance with relevant laws and regulations
	+ Assessment of subcontractor's security measures and data protection policies
* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks, such as:
	+ Conducting regular audits and monitoring subcontractor's performance
	+ Implementing contractual requirements and service level agreements
	+ Ensuring subcontractor's compliance with relevant laws and regulations
	+ Establishing clear communication channels and incident response plans

**Best Practice:** To ensure effective risk management, I recommend that Atlassian:

* Develop a comprehensive subcontractor risk management policy
* Establish a clear and transparent risk assessment process
* Conduct regular risk assessments and reviews of subcontractors
* Implement mitigation strategies to address identified risks
* Monitor and report on subcontractor performance and risk exposure

By implementing a risk evaluation process for subcontractors, Atlassian can ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, mitigate potential risks, and maintain a secure and reliable supply chain."
Identify clauses requiring evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains. Extract references to the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion. Suggest adding this requirement if absent.,"As a compliance officer, I have identified the following clauses that require evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains:

**Clause 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates)**: This clause states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any requirements for evaluating the length and complexity of subcontracting chains.

**Clause 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates)**: The clause mentions that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not provide any guidance on how to evaluate the length and complexity of subcontracting chains.

To address this requirement, I suggest adding the following language to Clause 20.11:

""Atlassian will maintain a subcontractor management program that evaluates the length and complexity of subcontracting chains to ensure that they do not pose an undue risk to the security and integrity of the Products and Customer Data. This program will include regular assessments of subcontractors' performance, security controls, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.""

Additionally, I recommend adding a requirement to track and monitor subcontractors' performance, security controls, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This can be achieved by:

* Requiring Atlassian to maintain a subcontractor registry that includes information on subcontractors' performance, security controls, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
* Establishing a regular review and assessment process to evaluate subcontractors' performance and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
* Requiring subcontractors to provide regular reports on their performance, security controls, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Monitoring Mechanisms: Unfortunately, this provision does not mention any specific tools or processes for monitoring subcontracting chains. However, to ensure compliance, I recommend including the following monitoring mechanisms:

1. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of subcontractors to ensure they are meeting their obligations and complying with the agreement.

5. **Reporting Requirements**: Establish regular reporting requirements for subcontractors to provide updates on their performance, compliance, and any changes to their subcontracting chains.
6. **Escalation Procedures**: Establish clear escalation procedures for addressing any issues or concerns related to subcontractor performance or compliance.
