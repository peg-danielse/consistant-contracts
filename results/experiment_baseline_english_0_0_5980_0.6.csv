"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have found the following clauses that address the retention of responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Section 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. This clause indicates that Atlassian, as the provider of the Products, is responsible for complying with laws applicable to its business, including DORA obligations.

**Section 15.5: Exceptions**

Atlassian's obligations in this Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) do not apply to the extent an Infringement Claim arises from: (a) Customer's modification or unauthorized use of the Products, (b) use of the Products in combination with items not provided by Atlassian (including Third-Party Products), (c) any unsupported release of the Software Products or Cloud Clients, or (d) Third-Party Products, Customer Data or Customer Materials.

This clause does not explicitly mention DORA, but it does indicate that Atlassian's obligations (including indemnification) do not apply to certain situations, which may include non-compliance with DORA obligations.

**Section 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

This clause suggests that Atlassian retains responsibility for its obligations, including DORA compliance, even if it uses subcontractors or Affiliates to perform its duties.

**Section 20.14: Government End-Users**

If Customer is a United States federal, state or local government customer, this Agreement is subject to, and is varied by, the Government Amendment available at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/government-amendment.

This clause does not explicitly mention DORA, but it does indicate that the Agreement is subject to government-specific amendments, which may include DORA obligations.

In conclusion, while the Agreement does not contain a clear statement that Atlassian retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, the clauses mentioned above suggest that Atlassian remains responsible for its obligations, including DORA compliance, even if it uses subcontractors or Affiliates to perform its duties."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:
 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","Upon reviewing the contract, I have identified the following key findings regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws:

The contract does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. While Section 10.2 (Taxes) mentions that Customer is responsible for any taxes or levies related to its Orders, it does not specifically address regulatory responsibilities.

However, Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. This provision implies that the financial entity is responsible for complying with relevant financial services laws, but it does not explicitly acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations.

Furthermore, the contract does not explicitly state that regulatory responsibilities cannot be delegated to third parties. While Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations, it does not address the delegation of regulatory responsibilities.

To address these concerns, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the contract that covers the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause could be included in Section 10 (Billing and Payment) or Section 20 (General Terms) and could be worded as follows:

""10.3 (Regulatory Responsibilities): The Financial Entity retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws and regulations, including but not limited to [list specific laws and regulations]. The Financial Entity acknowledges that it is responsible for ensuring ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations, and that it will not delegate this responsibility to any third party. The Financial Entity will maintain accurate and complete records of its compliance efforts and will provide Atlassian with reasonable access to these records upon request.""

This revised clause would provide clear and comprehensive coverage of the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws, including non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities and clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations."

**Approval Requirements:**

* Section 20.3 (Assignment) states that Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without Atlassian's prior written consent. This implies that Atlassian's approval is required for any changes to the agreement.
* Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement) mentions that Atlassian may modify this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications will take effect at the next Order or renewal unless either party elects to not renew. However, it does not explicitly state that senior management or board approval is required for such modifications.

**Review Procedures:**

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all applicable Laws in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any review procedures for ensuring compliance.
* Section 20.2 (Code of Conduct) requires Atlassian to comply with its Code of Conduct in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. While the Code of Conduct is available at https://investors.atlassian.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx, it does not specify any review procedures for ensuring compliance.

**Documentation of Approvals:**

* Section 20.5 (Notices) requires that notices under this Agreement must be in writing and are deemed given on personal delivery, receipt of a recognized overnight courier with receipt request, or the third business day after mailing. However, it does not specify any documentation requirements for approvals.

**Renewal Approval Processes:**

* Section 10.1 (Fees) states that a Subscription Term will automatically renew at Atlassian's then-current rates for a period equal to the prior Subscription Term. However, it does not explicitly state that senior management or board approval is required for such renewals.

**Governance Gap:**

Based on the review, I have identified a governance gap related to the lack of explicit approval requirements for senior management or the board of directors. Specifically:

* There is no clear requirement for senior management or board approval for modifications to the agreement or renewals of subscription terms.
* There is no documentation of approvals or review procedures for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and the Code of Conduct.

**Recommendation:**

* Atlassian shall establish and track the following performance metrics for its subcontractors and Affiliates:
	+ Service level agreement (SLA) compliance
	+ Customer satisfaction ratings
	+ Data protection incident response times
	+ Security breach detection and response rates
* Atlassian shall report on these metrics to senior management on a quarterly basis.

**Reporting Requirements to Senior Management:**

* Atlassian shall provide regular reports to senior management on the performance of its subcontractors and Affiliates, including:
	+ Quarterly monitoring results
	+ Performance metrics
	+ Any issues or concerns identified during the monitoring process
* Senior management shall review and discuss the reports with Atlassian's management team at least once every 6 months to ensure that the subcontractors and Affiliates are meeting the required standards.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that its subcontractors and Affiliates are properly monitored and managed, and that senior management is kept informed of any issues or concerns. This will help to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws."
