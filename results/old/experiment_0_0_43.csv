Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","**Compliance Review: Retained Responsibility for Financial Services Laws**

The contract clearly states that the financial entity remains fully responsible for compliance with and discharge of all obligations under this Regulation and applicable financial services law, as per Article 28, General Principles, Section 1(a). This comprehensive coverage of retained responsibility is a key aspect of the contract.

However, upon further review, it appears that the contract does not explicitly cover all applicable financial services laws, nor does it acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, there are no specific references to relevant financial services laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Payment Services Directive (PSD2).

**Recommendation**

To strengthen the contract and ensure compliance with relevant financial services laws, I recommend adding an explicit clause that retains the financial entity's regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should be clear, concise, and comprehensive, and should include specific references to relevant financial services laws. The revised clause could read:

""The Financial Entity acknowledges and agrees that it will retain full responsibility for compliance with and discharge of all obligations under all applicable financial services laws, including but not limited to [list relevant laws, such as GDPR, PSD2, etc.]. The Financial Entity will ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and will not delegate any regulatory responsibilities to third-party service providers or other entities.""

This revised clause will provide clarity and certainty regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for regulatory compliance, and will help to mitigate potential risks and liabilities associated with non-compliance."

2. Regulatory Compliance: The level of regulatory compliance required for the service, process, or function, including any specific laws, regulations, or industry standards that must be met.
3. Customer Impact: The potential impact on customers if the service, process, or function is unavailable or compromised, including any potential loss of business or revenue.
4. Operational Dependency: The level of operational dependency on the service, process, or function, including any potential cascading effects on other services, processes, or functions.
5. Security Risk: The level of security risk associated with the service, process, or function, including any potential vulnerabilities or threats.

Classification Levels:
The criticality assessment framework should include clear classification levels to categorize the criticality of service, process, or function dependencies. These levels can be based on the severity of the potential impact, risk, or consequences.

Example Classification Levels:

* Low: Minimal impact, low risk, and minimal consequences.
* Medium: Moderate impact, moderate risk, and moderate consequences.
* High: Significant impact, high risk, and significant consequences.
* Critical: Extreme impact, extreme risk, and extreme consequences.

Impact Thresholds:
The criticality assessment framework should include clear impact thresholds to determine the level of criticality based on the assessment criteria. These thresholds can be based on specific metrics or values, such as financial loss, downtime, or security breaches.

Example Impact Thresholds:

* Low: Financial loss < $10,000, downtime < 1 hour, security breaches < 1 incident.
* Medium: Financial loss $10,000 - $100,000, downtime 1-4 hours, security breaches 1-5 incidents.
* High: Financial loss $100,000 - $1,000,000, downtime 4-24 hours, security breaches 5-10 incidents.
* Critical: Financial loss > $1,000,000, downtime > 24 hours, security breaches > 10 incidents.

Review Requirements:
The criticality assessment framework should include clear review requirements to ensure that the criticality of service, process, or function dependencies is regularly reassessed and updated.

Example Review Requirements:

* Annual review of criticality assessment results to ensure that they remain accurate and relevant.
* Quarterly review of criticality assessment results to identify any changes in business impact, regulatory compliance, customer impact, operational dependency, or security risk.
* Real-time review of criticality assessment results to identify any changes in business impact, regulatory compliance, customer impact, operational dependency, or security risk.
