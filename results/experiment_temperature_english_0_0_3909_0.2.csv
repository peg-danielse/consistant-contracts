"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clauses that address the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Retained Responsibility**

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This implies that the financial entity retains responsibility for complying with DORA obligations.
* Section 20.1 also mentions that ""Atlassian must comply with its Code of Conduct in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" While this clause primarily addresses Atlassian's responsibilities, it reinforces the idea that the financial entity is responsible for its own compliance.

**References to DORA Obligations**

* Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This clause does not explicitly mention DORA, but it implies that the financial entity is responsible for ensuring that Atlassian's security program meets DORA requirements.

**Non-Transfer of Compliance Obligations**

* Section 20.3 (Assignment) states that ""Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian's prior written consent."" This clause does not explicitly address DORA compliance, but it implies that the financial entity cannot transfer its compliance obligations to Atlassian.

**Acknowledgment that Outsourcing Doesn't Diminish Entity's Responsibility**

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This clause acknowledges that outsourcing does not diminish Atlassian's responsibility, implying that the financial entity retains responsibility for ensuring that Atlassian meets its DORA obligations.

In summary, while the Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, the clauses mentioned above imply that the financial entity is responsible for ensuring that Atlassian meets its DORA obligations and that outsourcing does not diminish its responsibility."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:
 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that Atlassian has made a clear statement regarding its retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Specifically, Section 20.1 of the contract states that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

However, upon closer examination, it seems that the contract does not explicitly cover all applicable financial services laws. While Section 20.1 mentions compliance with ""all Laws,"" it does not specifically reference financial services laws. Furthermore, the contract does not contain a comprehensive list of applicable financial services regulations.

Moreover, the contract does not explicitly state that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party vendors or subcontractors. While Section 20.11 mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations, it does not address the retention of regulatory responsibilities.

To address these concerns, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the contract that covers the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause could be included in Section 20.1 and would provide clarity on Atlassian's ongoing regulatory obligations.

Here is a suggested revised clause:

""20.1. Compliance with Financial Services Laws. Each party must comply with all applicable financial services laws, regulations, and standards, including but not limited to, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. Atlassian retains full responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws and regulations, and will not delegate this responsibility to any third-party vendors or subcontractors. Atlassian will maintain a comprehensive compliance program that includes regular audits, risk assessments, and training programs to ensure ongoing compliance with all applicable financial services laws and regulations.""

This revised clause provides clear acknowledgment of Atlassian's ongoing regulatory obligations and ensures that the company retains full responsibility for compliance with all applicable financial services laws."

However, Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) requires Atlassian to defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party.

**Reporting Requirements to Senior Management:**
There are no specific reporting requirements to senior management regarding third-party arrangements. However, Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**
To ensure effective ongoing monitoring of third-party arrangements, I recommend adding structured monitoring requirements with specific timelines and metrics. This could include:

* Regular reviews of third-party arrangements every 6-12 months
* Performance metrics such as:
	+ Compliance with intellectual property rights

A clear timeline is essential to ensure that the transition is completed within the specified timeframe. The timeline should include key milestones, deadlines, and critical path activities. It should also allow for contingencies and flexibility to accommodate any unexpected issues that may arise during the transition.

**Resource Allocation:**

Sufficient resources, including personnel, equipment, and budget, are necessary to ensure a successful transition. The resource allocation plan should include a detailed breakdown of the resources required, including the skills and expertise needed to complete the transition.

**Knowledge Transfer:**

Knowledge transfer is critical to ensure that the knowledge and expertise of the outgoing team are transferred to the incoming team. This should include documentation of processes, procedures, and systems, as well as training and onboarding of the new team members.

**Data Migration Procedures:**

Data migration procedures should be clearly outlined to ensure that all data is accurately and securely transferred from the old system to the new system. This should include data validation, data cleansing, and data mapping to ensure that the data is accurate and complete.

**Compliance Gap:**

Based on the review, it appears that there is a compliance gap in the transition planning requirements. To address this gap, I recommend adding comprehensive transition planning requirements to ensure that all aspects of the transition are addressed. This should include:

* A detailed transition plan that outlines the scope of work, timelines, and milestones
* A clear timeline that includes key milestones, deadlines, and critical path activities
* A resource allocation plan that includes a detailed breakdown of the resources required
* A knowledge transfer plan that includes documentation of processes, procedures, and systems, as well as training and onboarding of the new team members
* Data migration procedures that include data validation, data cleansing, and data mapping

By addressing these compliance gaps, we can ensure that the transition is completed successfully and that service continuity is maintained."
