"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have found the following clauses that relate to the retention of financial entity's responsibility for DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) compliance:

**Retained Responsibility Clause:**

Section 20.1 of the Agreement states: ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This clause explicitly retains the financial entity's responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, including DORA obligations.

**DORA Obligations Reference:**

Although DORA is not explicitly mentioned in the Agreement, Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This clause implies that Atlassian is responsible for maintaining a security program that meets the DORA requirements.

**Non-Transfer of Compliance Obligations:**

Section 20.3(a) states: ""Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian’s prior written consent."" This clause suggests that the financial entity's DORA compliance obligations cannot be transferred to Atlassian without prior written consent.

**Acknowledgment of Outsourcing:**

Section 20.11 states: ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This clause acknowledges that outsourcing does not diminish the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance, as Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance and has written agreements in place with its subcontractors.

In summary, while the Agreement does not explicitly mention DORA, the retained responsibility clause, DORA obligations reference, non-transfer of compliance obligations, and acknowledgment of outsourcing all suggest that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:
 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the financial entity's (Atlassian's) retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws is not explicitly stated. While the agreement mentions various terms and conditions related to payments, taxes, and fees, it does not provide clear statements regarding Atlassian's retained responsibility for regulatory obligations.

Specifically, the agreement does not comprehensively cover all applicable regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Additionally, the agreement does not explicitly acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations or reference specific financial services laws.

The following sections are relevant to financial services laws, but they do not provide sufficient clarity:

* Section 10.2 (Taxes) mentions that fees and expenses are exclusive of any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies. However, it does not explicitly state that Atlassian is responsible for ensuring compliance with tax regulations.
* Section 10.4 (Suspension for Non-payment) mentions that Atlassian may suspend Customer's rights to use Products or receive Support or Advisory Services if payment is overdue. However, it does not explicitly state that Atlassian is responsible for ensuring compliance with financial services laws in the event of a payment suspension.
* Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) mentions that Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. However, it does not explicitly state that Atlassian is responsible for ensuring compliance with financial services laws in the event of an intellectual property infringement claim.

To address this gap, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the agreement that covers retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should:

* Clearly acknowledge Atlassian's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws
* Provide comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations, including AML and KYC requirements
* Explicitly state that Atlassian will ensure ongoing compliance with financial services laws
* Reference specific financial services laws, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Example of the recommended clause:

""Atlassian retains all responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws, including but not limited to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Atlassian will ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations, and will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third party. By entering into this Agreement, Customer acknowledges that Atlassian is responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws, and that Customer will not be held liable for any failure to comply with these laws.""

This recommended clause provides clear and explicit language regarding Atlassian's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws, ensuring that the agreement is comprehensive and compliant with relevant regulations."
"Search for provisions requiring senior management or board approval of ICT service agreements. Look for:
 • Approval requirements
 • Review procedures
 • Documentation of approvals
 • Renewal approval processes
 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as governance gap and recommend adding explicit board/senior management approval requirements.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following provisions related to senior management or board approval of ICT service agreements:

* **Approval requirements**: There is no explicit requirement for senior management or board approval for ICT service agreements. However, Section 20.3 (Assignment) mentions that Customer may assign this Agreement in its entirety (including all Orders) to its successor resulting from a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Customer's assets or voting securities, but requires written consent from Atlassian. This implies that significant changes to the agreement may require approval.
* **Review procedures**: There is no provision outlining specific review procedures for ICT service agreements.
* **Documentation of approvals**: There is no explicit requirement to document senior management or board approval for ICT service agreements.
* **Renewal approval processes**: There is no provision outlining specific renewal approval processes for ICT service agreements.

Given the absence of explicit requirements for senior management or board approval, I flag this as a governance gap and recommend adding explicit board/senior management approval requirements to ensure that ICT service agreements are subject to adequate oversight and approval.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding a clause to the agreement that requires senior management or board approval for:

* Initial ICT service agreements
* Significant changes to existing ICT service agreements
* Renewal of ICT service agreements
* Documentation of approvals for ICT service agreements

This will help ensure that senior management and the board are informed and involved in the approval process for ICT service agreements, aligning with best practices for IT governance."
"Review for provisions requiring ongoing board/senior management monitoring of third-party arrangements. Verify:

Follow-up if Missing: Suggest adding structured monitoring requirements with specific timelines and metrics.","**Compliance Review: Third-Party Arrangements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following provisions related to third-party arrangements:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) prohibits Customer from using the Products to develop a similar or competing product or service.
* Section 7.2 (Third-Party Products) states that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, but Customer's use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider's terms of use, not this Agreement.
* Section 10.1 (Fees) mentions that Customer is responsible for payment of all applicable amounts directly to the Reseller.

However, I have not found any specific provisions that require ongoing board/senior management monitoring of third-party arrangements. Therefore, I recommend adding structured monitoring requirements to ensure that Customer is regularly reviewing and evaluating its third-party arrangements.

**Recommendations**

1. **Regular Review Requirements**: Schedule regular reviews of third-party arrangements, such as quarterly or bi-annually, to assess their continued suitability and compliance with Customer's business objectives.
2. **Monitoring Frequency**: Establish a clear frequency for monitoring third-party performance, such as monthly or quarterly, to ensure timely identification of any issues or concerns.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Define specific performance metrics for third-party arrangements, such as service level agreements (SLAs), key performance indicators (KPIs), and return on investment (ROI), to measure their effectiveness.
4. **Reporting Requirements**: Require senior management to receive regular reports on third-party performance, including any issues or concerns identified during monitoring, to ensure ongoing oversight and decision-making.

**Structured Monitoring Requirements**

To address these recommendations, I suggest adding the following provisions to the Atlassian Customer Agreement:

* Section 12.2 (Termination for Convenience): Include language requiring Customer to conduct regular reviews of third-party arrangements and provide a plan for transitioning to alternative arrangements if necessary.
* Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian): Modify the indemnification provisions to include requirements for Customer to cooperate with Atlassian in monitoring and addressing any third-party-related issues or concerns.
* Section 20 (General Terms): Add a new paragraph requiring Customer to maintain records of its third-party arrangements, including monitoring and performance metrics, and to provide access to these records upon request.

By incorporating these structured monitoring requirements, Customer can ensure ongoing oversight and management of its third-party arrangements, reducing the risk of non-compliance and potential reputational damage."
"Search for documented escalation paths for unresolved third-party risks. Look for:
 • Clear escalation triggers
 • Escalation levels
 • Time frames for escalation
 • Resolution requirements
 • Board notification procedures

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding comprehensive escalation framework with specific triggers and procedures.","Compliance Review Findings: Escalation Framework for Third-Party Risks

After reviewing the documentation, it is evident that a comprehensive escalation framework for third-party risks is missing. This is a critical compliance requirement, as it ensures that unresolved third-party risks are properly addressed and escalated to the relevant stakeholders.

Clear escalation triggers, escalation levels, time frames for escalation, resolution requirements, and board notification procedures are essential components of a robust escalation framework. Without these elements, the organization may struggle to effectively manage and mitigate third-party risks, which can lead to non-compliance with regulatory requirements and potential reputational damage.

To address this compliance gap, I recommend that the organization develop and implement a comprehensive escalation framework with specific triggers and procedures. This framework should include:

1. Clear escalation triggers: Identify specific events or circumstances that trigger the escalation process, such as a high-risk finding or a material change in a third-party's risk profile.
2. Escalation levels: Establish a clear hierarchy of escalation levels, with specific requirements and responsibilities for each level, such as a Level 1 escalation for critical issues that require immediate attention.
3. Time frames for escalation: Define specific time frames for escalation, such as a 24-hour window for Level 1 escalations or a 72-hour window for Level 2 escalations.
4. Resolution requirements: Establish clear requirements for resolving escalated issues, including specific actions, deadlines, and responsible parties.
5. Board notification procedures: Develop procedures for notifying the board of directors or other relevant stakeholders of escalated issues, including the nature of the issue, the proposed resolution, and any necessary updates or follow-up actions.

By implementing a comprehensive escalation framework, the organization can ensure that third-party risks are properly managed and escalated, reducing the risk of non-compliance and reputational damage."

**Documentation Standards:** Section 20.5 (Notices) of the Agreement specifies that notices under this Agreement must be in writing and are deemed given on specific criteria, such as personal delivery, receipt by a recognized overnight courier, or email. However, it is recommended to establish clear documentation standards for escalation processes, including templates for escalation reports, communication protocols, and a record of all escalation activities.

**Record-Keeping Requirements:** While Section 10.2 (Taxes) mentions that Atlassian will itemize separate taxes or levies on invoices, there is no explicit mention of record-keeping requirements for escalation processes. It is essential to establish a clear record-keeping policy to track escalation activities, including dates, times, and details of interactions.

**Tracking Mechanisms:** Section 20.5 (Notices) implies that email notifications can be used for operational notices, but it is unclear if this applies to escalation processes. To ensure effective tracking, it is recommended to implement a dedicated tracking mechanism for escalation processes, such as a ticketing system or a spreadsheet, to monitor and manage escalation activities.

**Follow-up Procedures:** While Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) mentions that Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation, there is no explicit follow-up procedure for escalation processes. It is crucial to establish a clear follow-up procedure to ensure that all escalation activities are properly addressed and closed.

To address the identified documentation gaps, I recommend adding the following specific documentation requirements for escalation processes:

1. **Escalation Report Template:** Develop a standardized template for escalation reports, including fields for date, time, escalation reason, and outcome.
2. **Communication Protocol:** Establish a clear communication protocol for escalation processes, including contact information for key stakeholders and escalation procedures.

 • Risk identification methodologies
 • Assessment criteria
 • Risk categorization requirements
 • Impact evaluation procedures
 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Suggest implementing structured risk analysis framework with clear assessment criteria.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following provisions related to risk assessment:

**Risk Identification Methodologies:** While there are no explicit provisions detailing specific risk identification methodologies, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) and Section 6.2 (Product Assessment) suggest that Atlassian and the customer should be aware of potential risks and take steps to mitigate them. For example, Atlassian requires customers to ensure they have made all necessary disclosures and obtained all necessary rights and consents to use the Products.

**Assessment Criteria:** Section 14.4 (Special Claims) outlines the assessment criteria for determining the liability of Atlassian in the event of a breach of confidentiality. Specifically, it states that Atlassian's aggregate liability will be the lesser of two times the amounts paid to Atlassian for the Products giving rise to the breach or $5,000,000.

**Risk Categorization Requirements:** The Agreement does not specify explicit risk categorization requirements. However, Section 14.1 (Damages Waiver) suggests that Atlassian and the customer should categorize risks into different types, such as direct, indirect, and consequential damages.

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding detailed impact assessment requirements focusing on service continuity.","Based on the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several provisions related to service continuity. Here are the results:

The Agreement does not explicitly require a detailed impact assessment methodology for service continuity. However, it does outline continuity requirements in Section 4.2 (Security Program), which states that Atlassian will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

Section 4.3 (Service Levels) mentions service level commitments for Cloud Products, which are outlined in the Service Level Agreement. However, the Service Level Agreement is not explicitly linked to the main Agreement, and its content is not provided in the document.

Recovery objectives are not explicitly mentioned in the Agreement.

To improve service continuity, I recommend adding detailed impact assessment requirements to the Agreement. Specifically, the following requirements could be included:

* A requirement for the Customer to assess the potential impact of service disruptions on their business operations and identify critical systems and processes that rely on the Atlassian Products.
* A requirement for the Customer to provide Atlassian with information on their business continuity and disaster recovery plans, including their recovery objectives and timelines.
* A requirement for Atlassian to conduct regular impact assessments to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities to service continuity and to develop strategies to mitigate or eliminate these risks.
* A requirement for Atlassian to provide the Customer with regular updates on service continuity, including any planned maintenance or upgrades that may impact service availability.

The required evaluations should include:

1. **Business Structure:** Verify the customer's business structure, including ownership and control.
2. **Financial Stability:** Assess the customer's financial stability, including creditworthiness and payment history.
3. **Compliance History:** Review the customer's compliance history, including any past non-compliance or regulatory issues.
4. **Industry-Specific Requirements:** Evaluate the customer's compliance with industry-specific regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.

**Documentation Requirements:**

The following documentation requirements should be in place:

1. **Business Registration Documents:** Obtain copies of the customer's business registration documents, including articles of incorporation and business licenses.
2. **Financial Statements:** Request and review the customer's financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements.
3. **Compliance Certifications:** Obtain certifications from the customer regarding their compliance with industry-specific regulations.
4. **Background Checks:** Conduct background checks on key customer personnel, including directors and officers.

Follow-up if Missing: Suggest implementing structured ongoing monitoring framework.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several provisions related to monitoring provider performance. However, the scope of monitoring is limited to specific areas, and the frequency requirements are not explicitly stated. Here is a summary of my findings:

**Monitoring Scope:**
The agreement does not explicitly mention continuous monitoring of provider performance. However, it does require Atlassian to provide support and advisory services as described in the Order and applicable policies (Section 8). Additionally, Atlassian is responsible for maintaining a security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect customer data from unauthorized access (Section 4.2).

**Frequency Requirements:**
There are no explicit frequency requirements for monitoring provider performance. However, Atlassian is obligated to provide timely access to customer materials and personnel reasonably requested by Atlassian for support and advisory services (Section 8).

**Performance Metrics:**
The agreement does not explicitly outline specific performance metrics for Atlassian's support and advisory services. However, it does mention that Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the products, when and as provided by Atlassian, are free of any viruses, malware, or similar malicious code (Section 11.1).

**Reporting Obligations:**
Atlassian is not explicitly required to report on its performance metrics. However, it is obligated to provide notice to customers before taking any measures to limit access to, or remove, customer data or suspend customer access to products (Section 4.5).

**Recommendation:**
To ensure continuous monitoring of provider performance, I suggest implementing a structured ongoing monitoring framework. This framework could include:

* Regular reviews of Atlassian's support and advisory services, including performance metrics and reporting obligations.
* Timely notifications to customers in case of any issues or limitations with the products or services.
* Clearly defined frequency requirements for monitoring and reporting.
* Specific performance metrics to be measured and reported on.

By implementing such a framework, customers can have greater confidence in Atlassian's ability to provide reliable and secure products and services."

The contract does a good job of outlining the rights of both parties, including the rights of the Customer and Atlassian. However, there are some areas where the rights are not clearly delineated, such as the rights of Atlassian to modify or terminate the contract. For example, Section 9 (Ordering Process and Delivery) states that Atlassian may modify the contract or terminate it at any time, but it does not provide clear guidance on what circumstances would trigger such modifications or terminations.

**Comprehensive List of Obligations**

The contract provides a comprehensive list of obligations for both parties, including obligations related to payment, support, and data security. However, there are some areas where the obligations are not clearly defined, such as the obligations of the Customer to provide timely access to Customer Materials and personnel reasonably requested by Atlassian.

**Service Scope Definitions**

The contract provides clear definitions of the scope of services to be provided by Atlassian, including the scope of support and advisory services. However, there are some areas where the scope of services is not clearly defined, such as the scope of services related to the Atlassian Marketplace.

**Term and Termination Provisions**

The contract provides clear guidance on the term and termination provisions, including the circumstances under which either party may terminate the contract. However, there are some areas where the termination provisions could be improved, such as the provision for notice periods and the consequences of termination.

**Liability and Indemnification Clauses**

The contract provides clear liability and indemnification clauses, including provisions related to intellectual property infringement and data security breaches. However, there are some areas where the liability and indemnification provisions could be improved, such as the provision for limits on liability and the consequences of breach.

**Flagging Missing Essential Contract Elements**

Based on the review, the following essential contract elements are missing:

* Clear guidance on the circumstances under which Atlassian may modify or terminate the contract

Section 20.11 of the agreement mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, but it does not provide any detailed information on the functions that are being outsourced or the impact assessments that have been conducted.

To address this critical gap, I recommend that Atlassian provide detailed documentation of critical and important functions, including clear definitions, criticality criteria, impact assessments, and dependencies mapping. This will enable a thorough understanding of the outsourcing arrangements and the potential risks associated with them.

In particular, I suggest that Atlassian:

* Develop a clear and concise definition of critical functions, including a description of the specific tasks and activities that are being outsourced.
* Establish a set of criteria for determining the criticality of functions, including factors such as business impact, regulatory requirements, and data protection obligations.
* Conduct a thorough impact assessment of the outsourcing arrangements, including an analysis of the potential risks and consequences of any failures or disruptions.
* Create a dependencies mapping document that outlines the relationships between critical functions, subcontractors, and internal teams.

By providing this detailed documentation, Atlassian can ensure that its customers are fully informed about the outsourcing arrangements and can make informed decisions about their own risk management strategies."

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit DORA compliance requirements and documentation procedures.","**Compliance with DORA Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several compliance obligations related to the Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 8140.01, also known as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) or the Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DARS) requirements, which are commonly referred to as the Defense Operational Resilience Act (DORA). However, I must note that the agreement does not explicitly mention DORA.

**Specific DORA References**

While DORA is not explicitly mentioned, Section 6.2 of the agreement states that ""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use."" This implies that Customer is responsible for ensuring compliance with relevant regulations, including DORA, if applicable.

**Compliance Obligations**

Section 6.3 of the agreement states that ""Unless the parties have entered into a 'Business Associate Agreement,' Customer must not (and must not permit anyone else to) upload to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to process) any patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)."" This requirement can be interpreted as a compliance obligation, as it involves handling sensitive information.

**Monitoring Requirements**

Section 4.2 of the agreement states that ""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures."" This implies that Atlassian is responsible for monitoring its information security program to ensure compliance.

**Reporting Obligations**

Section 15.1 of the agreement states that ""Atlassian must: (a) defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party (an ‘Infringement Claim’), and (b) indemnify and hold harmless Customer against any damages, fines or costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or agreed in settlement by Atlassian resulting from an Infringement Claim."" This implies that Atlassian is responsible for reporting any intellectual property infringement claims.

**Recommendations**

Given the lack of explicit DORA compliance requirements and documentation procedures, I recommend that Atlassian:

1. Add explicit DORA compliance requirements to the agreement, outlining the specific obligations and responsibilities of both parties.
2. Develop documentation procedures to ensure that DORA compliance is properly documented, including incident response plans, security measures, and reporting requirements.
3. Review and update the agreement to include specific references to DORA and its requirements.

By implementing these recommendations, Atlassian can ensure that it meets its compliance obligations under DORA and provides its customers with clear guidance on their responsibilities."

Follow-up if Missing: Suggest adding comprehensive access control and security requirements for register maintenance.","Compliance Review Findings: Access Control and Security Requirements

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the access control and security requirements for register maintenance are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer some provisions related to access control and security from various sections of the agreement. Here are the key findings:

**Access Control Requirements:**

* The agreement does not explicitly mention access control requirements for register maintenance. However, Section 3.1 states that Customer is responsible for ensuring that each User keeps their login credentials confidential and promptly notifies Atlassian in case of unauthorized access.
* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) outlines general restrictions on the use of Products, including limitations on access and use.

**Security Measures:**

* The agreement mentions that Atlassian has implemented a security program (Section 4.2) to protect Customer Data, including physical, technical, and organizational measures.
* Atlassian's security practices are available on its website (https://www.atlassian.com/legal/security-measures).

**Audit Trail Requirements:**

* There are no explicit audit trail requirements mentioned in the agreement. However, Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) states that Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation, which may imply a requirement for audit trails.

**Confidentiality Provisions:**

* Section 16 (Confidentiality) outlines confidentiality obligations for both parties, including the handling of Confidential Information.
* However, the agreement does not specifically address confidentiality provisions related to register maintenance.

**Recommendations:**

To ensure comprehensive access control and security requirements for register maintenance, we suggest adding the following:

1. **Access Control Policy:** Develop a clear access control policy for register maintenance, including roles, responsibilities, and permissions.
2. **Register Access Controls:** Specify access control requirements for register maintenance, such as multi-factor authentication, password policies, and account lockout procedures.
3. **Security Measures:** Outline specific security measures for register maintenance, including encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.
4. **Audit Trail Requirements:** Establish audit trail requirements for register maintenance, including logs of access, changes, and deletions.
5. **Confidentiality Provisions:** Update confidentiality provisions to specifically address register maintenance, including handling of sensitive information.

By incorporating these recommendations, the agreement will provide a more comprehensive framework for access control and security requirements related to register maintenance."

 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as control gap and recommend adding comprehensive subcontracting restrictions aligned with DORA requirements.","**Compliance Finding:**

Atlassian's Customer Agreement contains provisions related to subcontracting, but they are not comprehensive and do not fully align with the requirements of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).

**Prohibited Activities:**

Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) of the Agreement states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement. However, it does not explicitly prohibit any specific activities that subcontractors or Affiliates may engage in.

**Geographic Restrictions:**

The Agreement does not impose any geographic restrictions on subcontracting. This means that Atlassian may subcontract work to entities located anywhere in the world, which could potentially increase the risk of data breaches or other security incidents.

**Service Type Limitations:**

Section 20.11 only allows Atlassian to use subcontractors or Affiliates for the performance of its obligations under the Agreement, without specifying any limitations on the types of services that can be subcontracted.

**Chain Length Restrictions:**

The Agreement does not impose any restrictions on the length of subcontracting chains. This means that Atlassian may subcontract work to multiple entities, which could potentially increase the risk of data breaches or other security incidents.

**Specific Excluded Functions:**

The Agreement does not explicitly exclude any specific functions from subcontracting. However, Section 15.5 (Exceptions) states that Atlassian's obligations under the indemnification clause do not apply to the extent an Infringement Claim arises from use of the Products in combination with items not provided by Atlassian, including Third-Party Products. This suggests that certain functions may be excluded from subcontracting, but it is not explicitly stated.

**Control Gap:**

Given the gaps in Atlassian's subcontracting provisions, I recommend that the company adds comprehensive subcontracting restrictions aligned with DORA requirements. This should include:

* Prohibited activities, such as outsourcing critical functions or sharing sensitive data with subcontractors
* Geographic restrictions, such as limiting subcontracting to entities located within specific geographic regions
* Service type limitations, such as excluding certain types of services from subcontracting
* Chain length restrictions, such as limiting the number of subcontracting levels
* Specific excluded functions, such as excluding critical functions like security, compliance, or data processing from subcontracting

By adding these provisions, Atlassian can better ensure the security, resilience, and continuity of its services, and comply with the requirements of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)."

Follow-up if Missing: Flag as continuity gap and suggest adding comprehensive transition planning requirements.","**Compliance Review Findings:**

After reviewing the requirements for service continuity during transition, it is clear that a comprehensive transition plan is essential to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted service delivery. The review revealed several areas that require attention to ensure continuity of service.

**Transition Plan Components:**

The transition plan must include the following components:

* Clear objectives and scope of work
* Timeline and milestones for completion
* Resource allocation, including personnel, equipment, and materials
* Knowledge transfer plan, including documentation and training for personnel
* Data migration procedures, including data validation and verification

**Timeline Requirements:**

A detailed timeline is crucial to ensure that all transition activities are completed on schedule. The timeline should include:

* Start and end dates for each transition activity
* Key milestones and deadlines
* Dependencies between activities and timelines

**Resource Allocation:**

Sufficient resources must be allocated to ensure the successful completion of transition activities. This includes:

* Personnel: Identify and assign personnel with the necessary skills and expertise
* Equipment and materials: Ensure that all necessary equipment and materials are available
* Budget: Allocate sufficient budget for transition activities

**Knowledge Transfer:**

Effective knowledge transfer is critical to ensure that personnel are equipped to continue providing services after the transition. The knowledge transfer plan should include:

* Documentation: Document all knowledge, processes, and procedures
* Training: Provide training and support for personnel
* Mentorship: Assign experienced personnel to mentor and support new personnel

**Data Migration Procedures:**

Data migration procedures must be clearly defined and executed to ensure that all data is transferred correctly. This includes:

* Data validation and verification
* Data mapping and reconciliation
* Data backup and recovery procedures

**Compliance Gap:**

Based on the review, it is clear that a comprehensive transition planning requirement is missing. To address this compliance gap, it is recommended that the organization develop a transition planning framework that includes the above components. This will ensure that all transition activities are well-planned, executed, and completed on schedule, thereby ensuring service continuity during transition."
