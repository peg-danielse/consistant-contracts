"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that relate to the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Retained Responsibility**

* Section 20.1 states that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This implies that the financial entity retains full responsibility for complying with DORA obligations.
* Section 20.3(a) states that ""Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian's prior written consent."" This suggests that the financial entity cannot transfer its compliance obligations to Atlassian.

**References to DORA Obligations**

* There is no explicit reference to DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) obligations in the agreement. However, Section 20.1 mentions compliance with ""all Laws applicable to its business,"" which could include DORA.

**Non-Transfer of Compliance Obligations**

* Section 20.3(a) explicitly states that the financial entity cannot assign or transfer its rights or obligations under the agreement, including compliance obligations, without Atlassian's prior written consent.

**Acknowledgment that Outsourcing Doesn't Diminish Entity's Responsibility**

* Section 20.11 states that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This suggests that while Atlassian may outsource certain tasks, it retains responsibility for ensuring compliance with DORA obligations.

In summary, while the agreement does not explicitly mention DORA, it implies that the financial entity retains full responsibility for complying with DORA obligations. The agreement also makes it clear that outsourcing certain tasks to Atlassian does not diminish the financial entity's responsibility for compliance."

The contract also explicitly acknowledges ongoing regulatory obligations, stating that Atlassian must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those related to export and import restrictions (Section 20.13).

However, it is recommended to add an explicit clause to the contract to ensure that Atlassian retains regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause could be added to Section 20.1, which currently states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business. The revised clause could read:

""20.1. Compliance with Laws. Atlassian retains responsibility for all applicable financial services laws and regulations, including but not limited to, anti-money laundering laws, know-your-customer regulations, and sanctions laws. Atlassian will comply with all such laws and regulations in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

This revised clause explicitly acknowledges Atlassian's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws and regulations, ensuring that the company is held accountable for its compliance obligations."

 • Dependency mapping requirements
 • Review and validation procedures
 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding comprehensive dependency documentation requirements with specific maintenance schedules.","**Compliance Review: Documentation and Maintenance of ICT Dependencies**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly outline requirements for documenting and maintaining records of ICT dependencies. However, it does provide some relevant information and guidelines that can be leveraged to meet these requirements.

**Documentation Standards**

While there is no explicit mention of documentation standards, the Agreement refers to the ""Documentation"" as Atlassian's usage guidelines and standard technical documentation for the applicable Product, available at https://support.atlassian.com/. This suggests that Atlassian has established a standard for documentation, which could be used as a basis for documenting ICT dependencies.

**Update Frequencies**

The Agreement does not specify update frequencies for documentation, but it does mention that Atlassian will provide support and advisory services as described in the Order and applicable Policies (Section 8). This implies that Atlassian may provide updates to documentation as part of its support services.

**Dependency Mapping Requirements**

There is no explicit mention of dependency mapping requirements in the Agreement. However, the Agreement does require Customer to provide Atlassian with access to Customer Materials and personnel reasonably requested by Atlassian (Section 8). This could be interpreted as a requirement for Customer to maintain accurate and up-to-date records of ICT dependencies, which would be necessary for Atlassian to provide effective support and advisory services.

**Review and Validation Procedures**

The Agreement does not specify review and validation procedures for documentation or ICT dependencies. However, it does require Atlassian to maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications (Section 4.2).

However, Section 14.1 (Damages Waiver) implies that Atlassian has assessed the potential risks associated with Customer's use of the Products, as it limits liability for certain damages, such as indirect, special, incidental, reliance, or consequential damages.

**Risk Categorization Requirements**

There is no explicit provision for risk categorization requirements in the Agreement. However, Section 14.2 (General Liability Cap) suggests that Atlassian has categorized risks based on their potential impact, as it limits liability to the amounts paid to Atlassian for the Products, Support, and Advisory Services during the relevant period.

**Impact Evaluation Procedures**

The Agreement does not provide explicit impact evaluation procedures. However, Section 14.1 (Damages Waiver) implies that Atlassian has evaluated the potential impact of certain risks, such as indirect, special, incidental, reliance, or consequential damages, and has chosen to limit liability for these types of damages.

**Follow-up and Recommendation**

Given the implicit nature of Atlassian's risk assessment framework, I recommend that the company implement a structured risk analysis framework with clear assessment criteria to ensure consistency and transparency in risk identification and evaluation. This framework should include:

1. A clear and comprehensive risk identification methodology

* Section 4.2 (Security Program) states that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
* Section 4.3 (Service Levels) mentions that service level commitments for the Cloud Products are set out in the Service Level Agreement, but it does not specify the monitoring scope, frequency requirements, or performance metrics.
* Section 10.4 (Suspension for Non-payment) requires Atlassian to give Customer at least 10 days' written notice before suspending Customer's rights to use the Products or receive Support or Advisory Services due to non-payment.

To address the gaps in the agreement, I suggest implementing a structured ongoing monitoring framework to ensure continuous monitoring of provider performance. This framework could include:

* Monitoring scope: Regularly review Atlassian's performance in delivering the agreed-upon services, including the Cloud Products, Support, and Advisory Services.
* Frequency requirements: Schedule regular check-ins with Atlassian to review performance metrics, address any issues, and discuss areas for improvement.
* Performance metrics: Establish clear performance metrics, such as uptime, response times, and customer satisfaction, to measure Atlassian's performance.
* Reporting obligations: Require Atlassian to provide regular reports on their performance, including any issues or areas for improvement.

A sample structured ongoing monitoring framework could include the following:

1. Quarterly review meetings with Atlassian to discuss performance metrics and address any issues.
2. Monthly reports from Atlassian on their performance, including uptime, response times, and customer satisfaction.
3. Annual review of the agreement to assess Atlassian's performance and make any necessary adjustments.
4. Regular communication with Atlassian to address any issues or concerns that arise.

By implementing this structured ongoing monitoring framework, Customer can ensure that Atlassian is meeting its performance obligations and address any issues promptly to minimize disruptions to the business."

This lack of specificity makes it challenging to measure and assess the effectiveness of the agreement's provisions. The absence of specific metrics, measurement methodologies, thresholds, and reporting requirements creates a gap in the compliance framework.

To address this issue, I recommend adding clearly defined KRIs and KPIs with specific measurement criteria. This will enable Atlassian to effectively monitor and report on the agreement's performance, identify potential risks, and take corrective actions to mitigate them. Some potential KRIs and KPIs that could be considered include:

* KRI: Customer Data Breach Rate
	+ Measurement Methodology: Track the number of data breaches per quarter
	+ Threshold: 0 breaches per quarter
	+ Reporting Requirements: Quarterly reports to Atlassian's management and compliance team
* KPI: Customer Satisfaction Rate
	+ Measurement Methodology: Conduct quarterly surveys to measure customer satisfaction
	+ Threshold: 90% customer satisfaction rate
	+ Reporting Requirements: Quarterly reports to Atlassian's management and compliance team
* KRI: Compliance Audit Findings
	+ Measurement Methodology: Conduct regular compliance audits to identify areas of non-compliance
	+ Threshold: 0 critical findings per audit
	+ Reporting Requirements: Quarterly reports to Atlassian's management and compliance team

By incorporating these KRIs and KPIs, Atlassian can establish a robust compliance framework that enables the company to proactively identify and address potential risks, ensuring the continued effectiveness of the agreement."
