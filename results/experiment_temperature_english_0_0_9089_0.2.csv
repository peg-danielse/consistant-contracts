"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clauses that address the financial entity's responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Retained Responsibility**

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This implies that the financial entity retains responsibility for complying with DORA obligations.
* Section 20.1 also mentions that ""Customer must comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products."" This suggests that the financial entity is responsible for ensuring compliance with DORA regulations.

**References to DORA Obligations**

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) does not explicitly mention DORA, but it implies that the financial entity must comply with relevant laws and regulations, which would include DORA obligations.
* Section 20.14 (Government End-Users) mentions the Government Amendment, which is available at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/government-amendment. This amendment may include DORA compliance obligations for government customers.

**Non-Transfer of Compliance Obligations**

* Section 20.3 (Assignment) states that ""Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian's prior written consent."" This implies that the financial entity cannot transfer its DORA compliance obligations to Atlassian or any other third party without explicit consent.

**Acknowledgment that Outsourcing Doesn't Diminish Entity's Responsibility**

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This suggests that even if the financial entity outsources certain functions to Atlassian or its subcontractors, it remains responsible for ensuring DORA compliance.

In summary, while the Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, the clauses mentioned above imply that the entity is responsible for complying with relevant laws and regulations, including DORA obligations."
" Review contract for clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Look for:
 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that Atlassian has made a clear statement regarding its retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Specifically, Section 20.1 of the contract states that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

However, upon closer examination, it seems that the contract does not explicitly cover all applicable financial services laws. While Section 10.2 (Taxes) mentions that Customer is responsible for any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies that apply to Customer's Orders, there is no comprehensive coverage of all applicable financial services regulations.

Furthermore, the contract does not explicitly state that Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers or subcontractors. While Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, it does not explicitly state that Atlassian will retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws.

Additionally, the contract does not contain a clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations. While Section 20.1 states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business, it does not explicitly state that Atlassian will continue to comply with all applicable financial services laws throughout the term of the Agreement.

Finally, the contract does not reference specific financial services laws, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

In light of these findings, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the contract that covers the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause could be added to Section 20.1 and would provide clarity on Atlassian's ongoing obligations to comply with all applicable financial services regulations.

Example of recommended clause:

""20.1. Compliance with Laws. Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to all applicable financial services laws, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and any other relevant laws and regulations. Atlassian will not delegate its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party providers or subcontractors and will retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable financial services laws throughout the term of this Agreement."""
"Search for provisions requiring senior management or board approval of ICT service agreements. Look for:
 • Approval requirements
 • Review procedures
 • Documentation of approvals
 • Renewal approval processes
 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as governance gap and recommend adding explicit board/senior management approval requirements.","**Compliance Finding:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires senior management or board approval for certain aspects of ICT service agreements, but there are gaps in the approval requirements and documentation procedures.

**Approval Requirements:**

The agreement requires Customer to obtain approval from senior management or the board for certain actions, such as:

* Section 20.3 (Assignment): Customer must obtain Atlassian's prior written consent for assigning this Agreement to its successor resulting from a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Customer's assets or voting securities.
* Section 20.9 (Changes to this Agreement): Atlassian may modify this Agreement, and for paid subscriptions, modifications will take effect at the next Order or renewal unless either party elects to not renew.

However, there are no explicit requirements for senior management or board approval for other critical aspects of ICT service agreements, such as:

* Initial approval of the agreement
* Renewal of the agreement
* Changes to the scope of use or services

**Review Procedures:**

The agreement does not specify any review procedures for ICT service agreements, which may lead to inadequate oversight and approval processes.

**Documentation of Approvals:**

The agreement does not require documentation of approvals, which may lead to a lack of transparency and accountability in the approval process.

**Renewal Approval Processes:**

The agreement requires automatic renewal of the agreement for paid subscriptions, unless either party elects to not renew. However, there is no explicit requirement for senior management or board approval for renewal.

**Governance Gap:**

The lack of explicit board/senior management approval requirements for ICT service agreements creates a governance gap. To address this gap, I recommend adding explicit approval requirements for the following:

* Initial approval of the agreement
* Renewal of the agreement
* Changes to the scope of use or services
* Documentation of approvals

This will ensure that senior management or the board is aware of and approves critical aspects of ICT service agreements, providing adequate oversight and accountability."
"Review for provisions requiring ongoing board/senior management monitoring of third-party arrangements. Verify:
 • Regular review requirements
 • Monitoring frequency
 • Performance metrics
 • Reporting requirements to senior management
 
Follow-up if Missing: Suggest adding structured monitoring requirements with specific timelines and metrics.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several provisions that require ongoing board/senior management monitoring of third-party arrangements. Specifically:

* Section 7.2 (Third-Party Products) states that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace. However, it does not specify regular review requirements or monitoring frequency.
* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) requires Atlassian to defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. However, it does not specify performance metrics or reporting requirements to senior management.
* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. However, it does not specify regular review requirements or monitoring frequency.

To address these gaps, I suggest adding structured monitoring requirements with specific timelines and metrics to the following sections:

* Section 7.2 (Third-Party Products): Add a requirement for Customer to regularly review and assess the use of third-party products with the Products, including their performance, security, and compliance with Laws. Specify a monitoring frequency, such as quarterly or bi-annually, and require Customer to report any issues or concerns to senior management.
* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification): Add performance metrics, such as the number of third-party claims defended or the percentage of claims resolved without litigation, to measure Atlassian's performance under this provision. Require Atlassian to report these metrics to senior management on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually.
* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws): Add regular review requirements and monitoring frequency, such as annually or bi-annually, to ensure that both parties are complying with all applicable Laws. Require both parties to report any issues or concerns to senior management and to take corrective action as necessary.

Example of revised language:

* Section 7.2 (Third-Party Products): ""Customer shall regularly review and assess the use of third-party products with the Products, including their performance, security, and compliance with Laws. Customer shall monitor the use of third-party products on a quarterly basis and report any issues or concerns to senior management within 30 days of discovery.""
* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification): ""Atlassian shall defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. Atlassian shall report to senior management on a quarterly basis the number of third-party claims defended and the percentage of claims resolved without litigation.""
* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws): ""Each party shall comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. Each party shall conduct an annual review of its compliance with Laws and report any issues or concerns to senior management. Each party shall take corrective action as necessary to ensure compliance with Laws."""

* Clear notice requirements, including format, timing, and content
* A definition of material breach and non-compliance criteria
* A detailed process for termination, including any necessary steps or timelines
* A clear explanation of the consequences of termination, including any applicable fees or penalties

By adding these provisions, the Agreement will provide a clearer understanding of the termination process and reduce the risk of disputes or misunderstandings."
"Review requirements for service continuity during transition. Verify:
 ▪ Transition plan components
 ▪ Timeline requirements
 ▪ Resource allocation
 ▪ Knowledge transfer
 ▪ Data migration procedures
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as continuity gap and suggest adding comprehensive transition planning requirements.","**Compliance Review: Service Continuity during Transition**

Upon reviewing the requirements for service continuity during transition, it is evident that a comprehensive transition plan is essential to ensure seamless service delivery. The transition plan components, timeline requirements, resource allocation, knowledge transfer, and data migration procedures are critical elements that must be thoroughly addressed to avoid any continuity gaps.

**Transition Plan Components:**

The transition plan should include a detailed description of the transition process, including the scope of work, timelines, and milestones. It should also outline the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved in the transition, including the project manager, team members, and external vendors.

**Timeline Requirements:**

A realistic timeline should be established to ensure that the transition is completed within the agreed-upon timeframe. The timeline should include key milestones, deadlines, and critical path activities to ensure that the transition stays on track.

**Resource Allocation:**

Sufficient resources, including personnel, equipment, and budget, should be allocated to support the transition. This includes identifying and assigning a project manager, team members, and external vendors as needed.

**Knowledge Transfer:**

Knowledge transfer is a critical component of the transition plan. It involves documenting and sharing knowledge, skills, and expertise between the old and new teams. This includes training, documentation, and onboarding processes to ensure that the new team is equipped to take over the service.

**Data Migration Procedures:**

Data migration procedures should be thoroughly planned and executed to ensure that all data is accurately transferred from the old system to the new system. This includes data validation, data cleansing, and data mapping to ensure that the data is accurate and complete.

**Compliance Gap:**

Based on the review, it appears that there is a compliance gap in the transition planning requirements. To address this gap, I recommend adding comprehensive transition planning requirements to the service continuity plan. This should include:

* A detailed transition plan that outlines the scope of work, timelines, and milestones
* A realistic timeline with key milestones, deadlines, and critical path activities
* Sufficient resource allocation, including personnel, equipment, and budget
* A comprehensive knowledge transfer plan that includes training, documentation, and onboarding processes
* Thorough data migration procedures that include data validation, data cleansing, and data mapping

By addressing these compliance gaps, the service continuity plan will be more robust, and the transition will be more successful, ensuring that the service is delivered with minimal disruption to customers."
