"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clauses that address the retention of responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Clause 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. This clause implies that the financial entity (Customer) retains responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, including DORA obligations.

**Clause 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. This clause does not explicitly state that the financial entity retains responsibility for DORA compliance, but it implies that Atlassian is responsible for ensuring its subcontractors comply with applicable laws.

**Clause 20.1: Compliance with Laws** (again)

This clause is repeated in the Definitions section, which states that ""Laws"" means all applicable laws, regulations, conventions, decrees, decisions, orders, judgments, codes and requirements of any government authority (federal, state, local or international) having jurisdiction. This clause reinforces the idea that the financial entity (Customer) retains responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, including DORA obligations.

**No explicit clauses**

Unfortunately, I did not find any explicit clauses that clearly state the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance, references DORA obligations, or acknowledges that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility. However, the repeated emphasis on compliance with applicable laws and regulations implies that the financial entity retains responsibility for ensuring compliance with DORA obligations."

 • Comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations
 • Non-delegation of regulatory responsibilities
 • Clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations
 • References to specific financial services laws

Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws is not explicitly stated. While the agreement does mention compliance with Laws (Section 20.1) and the provision of Support and Advisory Services (Section 8), it does not specifically address the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws.

A comprehensive review of the agreement reveals that it does not provide clear statements regarding the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws. Specifically, the agreement does not:

* Provide comprehensive coverage of all applicable regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.
* Clearly acknowledge ongoing regulatory obligations, such as regular reporting and record-keeping requirements.
* Reference specific financial services laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) or the USA PATRIOT Act.

To address this gap, I recommend adding an explicit clause to the agreement that covers the retention of regulatory responsibilities for all applicable financial services laws. This clause should include:

* A clear statement of the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws.
* A comprehensive list of applicable regulations, including AML and KYC regulations.
* A clear acknowledgment of ongoing regulatory obligations, including regular reporting and record-keeping requirements.
* References to specific financial services laws, such as the BSA and the USA PATRIOT Act.

Example of the recommended clause:

""20.16 Financial Services Laws. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for complying with all applicable financial services laws, including but not limited to:

* Anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.
* Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and USA PATRIOT Act requirements.
* Regular reporting and record-keeping requirements.

Customer agrees to maintain accurate and up-to-date records of all financial transactions and to provide Atlassian with any information or documentation required to comply with applicable financial services laws. Customer acknowledges that it is responsible for ensuring that all financial transactions are conducted in accordance with applicable financial services laws and regulations.""

By adding this clause, the agreement will provide clear and comprehensive coverage of the financial entity's retained responsibility for all applicable financial services laws, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and minimizing the risk of non-compliance."

Follow-up if Missing: Suggest implementing structured ongoing monitoring framework.","**Compliance Review: Continuous Monitoring of Provider Performance**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that there is a lack of clear provisions for continuous monitoring of provider performance. Specifically, the agreement does not explicitly outline the scope, frequency, performance metrics, and reporting obligations for monitoring Atlassian's performance as a provider.

**Monitoring Scope**

The agreement does not specify the scope of monitoring, which is essential to ensure that all aspects of Atlassian's performance are being evaluated. A structured monitoring framework should be implemented to cover key areas such as product quality, customer support, security, and compliance.

**Frequency Requirements**

There are no frequency requirements outlined in the agreement for monitoring Atlassian's performance. Regular monitoring should be conducted at least quarterly, with more frequent monitoring for critical areas such as security and compliance.

**Performance Metrics**

The agreement does not specify the performance metrics that will be used to evaluate Atlassian's performance. A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) should be established to measure Atlassian's performance, including metrics such as:

* Product quality and reliability
* Customer satisfaction and support
* Security and compliance
* Timeliness and responsiveness

**Reporting Obligations**

The agreement does not outline the reporting obligations for monitoring Atlassian's performance. Regular reports should be provided to the customer, detailing Atlassian's performance against the established KPIs.

**Recommendation**

To address these gaps, I recommend implementing a structured ongoing monitoring framework that includes:

1. Clearly defining the monitoring scope and frequency requirements.
2. Establishing a set of performance metrics (KPIs) to evaluate Atlassian's performance.
3. Outlining reporting obligations to ensure regular and timely reporting to the customer.
4. Conducting regular monitoring and reporting to ensure Atlassian's performance meets the agreed-upon standards.

By implementing a structured monitoring framework, the customer can ensure that Atlassian's performance is being continuously evaluated and improved, providing a higher level of assurance and compliance with regulatory requirements."

By addressing these gaps and adding comprehensive testing requirements, the organization can ensure that controls and procedures are regularly evaluated, and testing gaps are identified and addressed in a timely manner."
"Search for clear termination provisions. Look for:
 • Termination triggers
 • Notice requirements
 • Material breach definitions
 • Non-compliance criteria
 • Process requirements
 ▪ 
Follow-up if Missing: Recommend adding detailed termination provisions.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified some clear termination provisions, but there are also some areas that could be clarified or expanded for better compliance. Here's a summary:

**Clear Termination Provisions:**

1. Section 12.2 (Termination for Convenience) states that Customer may terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term upon notice for any reason, subject to Section 10.3 (Return Policy).
2. Section 12.3 (Termination for Cause) outlines the circumstances under which either party may terminate this Agreement or a Subscription Term, including failure to cure a material breach, cessation of operation, or bankruptcy.
3. Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) describes the consequences of termination, including the cessation of Customer's rights to use the applicable Products, Support, or Advisory Services.

**Missing or Unclear Provisions:**

1. **Termination Triggers:** While Section 12.3 lists some termination triggers, it would be beneficial to have a more comprehensive list of specific events that may trigger termination, such as non-payment of fees, breach of confidentiality obligations, or unauthorized use of the Products.
2. **Notice Requirements:** Section 12.2 requires notice for termination, but it would be helpful to specify the exact notice period, method of delivery, and content requirements.
3. **Material Breach Definitions:** Section 12.3 mentions ""material breach,"" but it would be beneficial to define what constitutes a material breach and provide examples.
4. **Non-Compliance Criteria:** The Agreement does not explicitly outline the criteria for determining non-compliance with the terms and conditions. Adding a clear definition of non-compliance would help prevent disputes.
5. **Process Requirements:** While Section 12.4 describes the consequences of termination, it would be helpful to outline the specific steps that Customer and Atlassian must take during the termination process, such as providing notice, returning or deleting data, and ceasing use of the Products.

**Recommendation:**

To enhance compliance and clarity, I recommend adding detailed termination provisions to the Agreement. This could include:

* A comprehensive list of termination triggers
* Specific notice requirements, including notice period, method of delivery, and content
* A clear definition of material breach and non-compliance
* A detailed process for termination, including steps for Customer and Atlassian
* A timeline for termination, including any applicable notice periods or waiting periods

By incorporating these provisions, the Agreement will provide a clearer understanding of the termination process and reduce the risk of disputes or misunderstandings."
"Review requirements for service continuity during transition. Verify:
 ▪ Transition plan components
 ▪ Timeline requirements
 ▪ Resource allocation
 ▪ Knowledge transfer
 ▪ Data migration procedures
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing: Flag as continuity gap and suggest adding comprehensive transition planning requirements.","**Compliance Review: Service Continuity during Transition**

Upon reviewing the requirements for service continuity during transition, it is evident that a comprehensive transition plan is crucial to ensure seamless service delivery. The transition plan components, timeline requirements, resource allocation, knowledge transfer, and data migration procedures are all critical elements that must be addressed to ensure continuity.

**Transition Plan Components:**

The transition plan should include a detailed description of the transition process, including the scope of work, timelines, and milestones. It should also outline the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved in the transition, including the project team, customers, and vendors.

**Timeline Requirements:**

A clear timeline is essential to ensure that the transition is completed within the agreed-upon timeframe. The timeline should include key milestones, deadlines, and critical path activities to ensure that the transition is completed on schedule.

**Resource Allocation:**

Sufficient resources, including personnel, equipment, and budget, must be allocated to ensure the successful completion of the transition. This includes identifying and assigning the necessary resources, including project managers, technical experts, and support staff.

**Knowledge Transfer:**

Knowledge transfer is critical to ensure that the transition is completed smoothly and that the new service provider is equipped to provide ongoing support. This includes documenting processes, procedures, and knowledge bases, as well as providing training and support to the new service provider.

**Data Migration Procedures:**

Data migration procedures should be clearly outlined to ensure that all customer data is accurately transferred to the new service provider. This includes identifying and documenting all data sources, data formats, and data transfer protocols.

**Compliance Gap:**

Based on the review, it appears that there is a compliance gap in the transition planning requirements. To address this gap, I recommend adding comprehensive transition planning requirements to the service continuity plan. This should include:

* A detailed transition plan that outlines the scope of work, timelines, and milestones
* A clear timeline that includes key milestones, deadlines, and critical path activities
* Sufficient resource allocation, including personnel, equipment, and budget
* Comprehensive knowledge transfer procedures to ensure that the new service provider is equipped to provide ongoing support
* Detailed data migration procedures to ensure accurate transfer of customer data

By addressing these compliance gaps, we can ensure that the transition is completed smoothly and that service continuity is maintained."
