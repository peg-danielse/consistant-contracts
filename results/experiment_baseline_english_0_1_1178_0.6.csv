"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","After reviewing the contract, I found that there is no explicit mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider.

**Gap identified:**

The contract does not include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider, which is a critical aspect of ensuring business continuity and managing risks associated with third-party dependencies.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I recommend that the contract be amended to include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider. This could involve defining criteria for determining substitutability, such as:

* The provider's ability to deliver equivalent or better services
* The provider's financial stability and creditworthiness
* The provider's operational capabilities and scalability
* The provider's commitment to data security and confidentiality
* The provider's reputation and track record

By including such provisions, the contract can ensure that the provider is easily substitutable in case of a disruption or termination, thereby minimizing the risk of business disruption and ensuring continuity of services.

**Extracted clauses:**

While no specific clauses address the substitutability of the provider, the following clauses may be relevant to this discussion:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) mentions that Customer must not provide access to the Products to a third party, other than to Users, which implies that the provider may be considered a third party.
* Section 5.1 (Modifications) mentions that Customer may use Modifications with the Software Products, but Customer must not distribute source code or Modifications to third parties.
* Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) mentions that Atlassian will indemnify Customer against third-party claims, including those related to intellectual property infringement.

However, these clauses do not specifically address the substitutability of the provider, and the contract should be amended to include provisions for assessing substitutability."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","The contract between Atlassian and the customer does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. While it mentions technical compatibility and operational complexity, these terms are not clearly defined or quantified.

To address this, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as:

* Cost: a clear definition of the costs associated with transitioning to a new product or service, including any potential savings or expenses.
* Technical specifications: a detailed description of the technical requirements for the new product or service, including any compatibility or interoperability issues.
* Ease of transition: a clear definition of the steps and resources required to transition from the current product or service to the new one, including any training or support needed.

Industry standards for substitutability assessments may include:

* The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9126 standard for software quality, which includes criteria for evaluating the substitutability of software products.
* The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework, which provides a structured approach to evaluating the maturity of an organization's processes and identifying areas for improvement.
* The IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework, which provides guidance on service management and IT service delivery, including criteria for evaluating the substitutability of IT services.

By incorporating these measurable criteria and industry standards, the contract can provide a clear and objective framework for assessing substitutability and making informed decisions about product or service transitions."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","After reviewing the contract, I found that there is no explicit requirement to document alternative providers in the market. However, there are some clauses that imply a need for documentation or consideration of alternatives:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) mentions that Customer must not use the Products to develop a similar or competing product or service, which implies that Atlassian may be concerned about Customer's ability to switch to alternative providers.
* Section 10.3 (Return Policy) mentions that Customer may terminate the Subscription Term for a Product within 30 days of its initial Order, which suggests that Atlassian wants to ensure that Customer has a clear understanding of their options and obligations.
* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) mentions that Atlassian will defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. This clause implies that Atlassian may be concerned about the potential for alternative providers to infringe on their intellectual property rights.

However, I did not find any explicit requirement to maintain a list of alternative providers or to conduct regular market scans to identify and document such providers.

To address this gap, I recommend including a clause that mandates regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This clause could be added to Section 20 (General Terms) and would provide clarity on the expectations for documentation and consideration of alternatives.

Here is a sample clause that could be added:

* 20.16 (Market Scans): Atlassian and Customer agree to conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers that offer similar or competing products or services. The parties will maintain a list of such providers and update it as necessary. The list will be made available to each party upon request.

This clause would require both parties to maintain a list of alternative providers and to update it regularly. It would also provide a clear process for requesting access to the list, which would help to ensure that both parties have a clear understanding of their options and obligations."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I confirm that there are no provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. This is a notable omission, as conducting regular cost-benefit analyses can help organizations maintain strategic flexibility and ensure they are getting the best value from their vendors.

In the absence of such provisions, I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to the agreement. This would involve including language that requires Atlassian to perform a thorough analysis of its services and compare them to those of alternative providers on a regular basis. The analysis should consider financial, operational, and strategic factors, including but not limited to:

* Cost savings: comparing the costs of Atlassian's services to those of alternative providers
* Operational efficiency: evaluating the ease of use, integration, and scalability of Atlassian's services compared to alternative providers
* Strategic alignment: assessing whether Atlassian's services align with the customer's overall business strategy and goals
* Innovation and R&D: comparing the level of innovation and research and development investment made by Atlassian and alternative providers

By including such provisions, the agreement can ensure that Atlassian remains competitive and continues to deliver value to its customers. This can also help customers to make informed decisions about their vendor relationships and ensure they are getting the best possible service."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","**Compliance Observation:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks provisions for maintaining awareness of market alternatives, which is a critical aspect of compliance with competition laws.

**Extracted Provision:** None. There are no clauses in the Atlassian Customer Agreement that specifically require maintaining awareness of market alternatives through periodic market research.

**Validation:** The absence of such provisions raises concerns about Atlassian's ability to demonstrate a good faith effort to stay informed about market developments and emerging alternatives. This is particularly important in industries where competition is fierce and market dynamics are constantly evolving.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. This could be achieved by incorporating a clause that requires Atlassian to:

* Conduct regular market research (e.g., quarterly or annually) to stay informed about emerging alternatives and market trends
* Maintain a record of market research and analysis to demonstrate compliance with this provision
* Report on the results of market research to senior management or the board of directors to ensure that the company is aware of potential risks and opportunities

**Example Clause:**

""7.1. Market Awareness. Atlassian shall maintain a good faith effort to stay informed about market developments and emerging alternatives. To this end, Atlassian shall conduct regular market research (at least quarterly) to evaluate emerging alternatives and market trends. Atlassian shall maintain a record of market research and analysis and report on the results to senior management or the board of directors. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that Atlassian remains aware of potential risks and opportunities and can make informed decisions about its business strategy.""

By incorporating this provision, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to maintaining awareness of market alternatives and reduce the risk of non-compliance with competition laws."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there are no specific requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. However, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) does mention that Customer must not provide access to the Products to a third party, other than to Users, and that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.

While this suggests that Atlassian may have some level of oversight over Customer's use of the Products, it does not explicitly require a comprehensive assessment of existing arrangements with the provider.

To confirm, Section 9 (Ordering Process and Delivery) states that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use, but this is not a requirement for existing arrangements.

Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use, but this is also not a requirement for existing arrangements.

Therefore, it appears that there are gaps in the contract regarding periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider. I recommend including a clause that requires Customer to conduct regular reviews of existing contracts with the provider to ensure compliance with the contract terms and to identify any potential risks or areas for improvement.

Specifically, the recommended clause could state:

""Customer shall conduct a comprehensive review of all existing contracts with Atlassian at least annually to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement and to identify any potential risks or areas for improvement. The review shall include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the number, type, and scope of existing arrangements with Atlassian, as well as any changes to Customer's business or operations that may impact the terms of the existing contracts.""

This clause would help to ensure that Customer is taking a proactive approach to managing its existing arrangements with Atlassian and identifying any potential risks or areas for improvement."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision related to third-party code and third-party products (Section 7). This provision requires Atlassian to include certain terms and conditions in its agreements with third-party providers, including those related to intellectual property rights and liability.

Specifically, Section 7.1 requires Atlassian to include in its agreements with third-party providers a provision that states that the third-party provider's code is provided ""as-is"" and that Atlassian makes no warranties or representations with respect to the code. Additionally, Section 7.2 requires Atlassian to include in its agreements with third-party providers a provision that limits the third-party provider's liability for damages to the amount paid by Atlassian for the third-party provider's services.

However, I have not found any provisions in the Atlassian Customer Agreement that require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Therefore, I recommend flagging the absence of this requirement and suggesting that the contract be updated to include provisions that evaluate risks from connected providers.

In particular, I suggest adding a clause that requires Atlassian to:

* Identify and document all closely connected providers that provide services or products to Atlassian or its customers;
* Assess the risks associated with these relationships, including the potential for conflicts of interest, data breaches, or other security risks;
* Develop and implement policies and procedures to manage these relationships and mitigate any identified risks;
* Report on the assessment and mitigation of these risks to customers and other stakeholders as required.

By including these provisions, the contract can ensure that Atlassian is taking steps to manage the risks associated with its relationships with closely connected providers and that customers are aware of these risks and the measures being taken to mitigate them."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that may imply a concentration risk:

1. **Section 20.13: Export Restrictions** - This clause requires the customer to comply with export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. If the customer is relying on a single provider for multiple services, they may be exposed to concentration risks if that provider is not compliant with these regulations.
2. **Section 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates** - This clause allows Atlassian to use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the agreement. If the customer is relying on a single provider for multiple services, they may be exposed to concentration risks if that provider is not transparent about its subcontractors or affiliates.
3. **Section 10.1: Fees** - This clause allows Atlassian to charge the customer for additional services or features, which may increase the customer's reliance on a single provider. If the customer is not careful, they may become overly dependent on Atlassian for multiple services, increasing their concentration risk.

However, upon closer inspection, I did not find any explicit clauses that require tracking dependency on the provider or analyzing concentration risks. To address this gap, I recommend adding a section to the contract that explicitly requires the customer to evaluate and address concentration risks.

**Recommendation:** Add a section to the contract that requires the customer to:

* Identify and assess the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services
* Develop a plan to mitigate concentration risks, such as diversifying services or providers
* Regularly review and update the plan to ensure continued compliance with concentration risk management requirements

This addition will help ensure that the customer is aware of the potential concentration risks and takes steps to mitigate them, promoting a more resilient and sustainable partnership with Atlassian."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","**Compliance Assessment: Third-Party Provider Interdependencies**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that assesses interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Section 7.2 states:

""7.2. Third-Party Products. Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.""

This provision acknowledges that the use of Third-Party Products with Atlassian's Products may create interdependencies, which can amplify operational risks. However, it also clarifies that Atlassian does not control or have liability for these Third-Party Products.

**Recommendation**

To further mitigate operational risks, I suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This can be achieved by:

* Requiring customers to conduct a thorough risk assessment of their use of Third-Party Products with Atlassian's Products.
* Encouraging customers to implement controls and mitigation strategies to manage these risks.
* Providing guidance and resources to customers on how to assess and mitigate operational risks associated with Third-Party Products.

By taking these steps, customers can better understand the potential risks associated with using Third-Party Products and take proactive measures to mitigate them."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that may be relevant to the evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk:

* Section 20.13, ""Export Restrictions,"" mentions that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. However, this clause does not explicitly address the provider's market share or concentration risk.
* Section 20.1, ""Compliance with Laws,"" requires each party to comply with all Laws applicable to its business, but does not specifically address the provider's market dominance or its potential impact on resilience.
* Section 20.5, ""Notices,"" provides a mechanism for Atlassian to notify customers of changes to the Agreement, but does not address the provider's market share or concentration risk.

However, I did not find any clauses that explicitly require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk. Therefore, I recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.

Specifically, I suggest adding a clause that requires Atlassian to:

* Provide information about its market share and concentration risk, including its market position and any potential monopolistic practices;
* Disclose any dependencies on third-party suppliers or vendors that may impact the resilience of the Products;
* Implement measures to mitigate the risks associated with provider dominance, such as implementing redundant systems or backup providers;
* Provide a clear process for customers to report any concerns or issues related to provider dominance or concentration risk.

By adding these terms, customers can better understand the potential risks associated with Atlassian's market dominance and take steps to mitigate those risks."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","After reviewing the contract, it appears that there is no specific assessment or provision addressing geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. The contract does not mention risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.

However, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) of the contract specifies that the laws of the Republic of Ireland will govern the agreement if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and the laws of the State of California will govern if the customer is domiciled elsewhere. This provision may imply a certain level of risk associated with the provider's operations in different jurisdictions, but it does not explicitly address geographical concentration risks.

To address this gap, I recommend that the contract be revised to include a provision that requires the provider to conduct a geographical risk assessment and to disclose any risks associated with its operations in different locations. This provision could be included in Section 20 (General Terms) or as a separate section, and could require the provider to:

* Conduct a regular risk assessment of its operations in different locations
* Disclose any risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters
* Provide a plan for mitigating or managing these risks
* Regularly review and update the risk assessment and mitigation plan

By including this provision, the contract can better address the risks associated with geographical concentration and ensure that the customer is aware of any potential risks and can take steps to mitigate them."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several clauses related to data protection and third-country providers. Here are the extracted provisions:

**Clause 4.2: Security Program**

""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures.""

**Clause 4.2: Service Levels**

""Where applicable, service level commitments for the Cloud Products are set out in the Service Level Agreement.""

**Clause 4.5: Removals and Suspension**

""Atlassian has no obligation to monitor Customer Data. Nonetheless, if Atlassian becomes aware that: (a) Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others (including relating to a takedown request received following the guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations), or (b) Customer’s use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may: (i) limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or (ii) suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the relevant Cloud Products.""

**Clause 16: Confidentiality**

""The receiving party must: (a) hold the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, and (b) only use such Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement.""

**Clause 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

These provisions indicate that Atlassian has implemented measures to protect customer data and ensure compliance with laws, including data protection regulations. However, I would like to suggest including more explicit language to ensure that third-country providers comply with EU data protection regulations, such as the GDPR.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure compliance with EU data protection regulations, I recommend adding the following clause:

""Any third-country provider that processes Customer Data must comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any other applicable EU data protection regulations. The third-country provider must ensure that its data processing activities meet the requirements of the GDPR and any other applicable EU data protection regulations, including the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality.""

This clause would provide more explicit language to ensure that third-country providers comply with EU data protection regulations and provide an additional layer of protection for customer data."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several clauses that assess the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, specifically in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance. These clauses are primarily found in Section 20 (General Terms) and Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue).

Specifically, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) states that the Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland if the Customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of the State of California if the Customer is domiciled elsewhere. This clause suggests that Atlassian has considered the laws of different jurisdictions and has chosen to be governed by the laws of these jurisdictions.

Additionally, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) also specifies that the jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the Agreement will be in the courts of the Republic of Ireland or the state and United States federal courts located in San Francisco, California, depending on the Customer's domicile. This clause indicates that Atlassian has considered the jurisdiction and venue for potential disputes and has chosen to be subject to the laws and courts of these jurisdictions.

Furthermore, Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under the Agreement. This clause suggests that Atlassian has considered the regulatory compliance requirements in different jurisdictions and has included a provision to ensure that both parties comply with all applicable laws.

In light of these clauses, it appears that Atlassian has taken steps to assess the effectiveness of law enforcement in its jurisdiction and has included provisions to ensure contract enforceability and regulatory compliance. However, as recommended, it may be beneficial to add specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider's country to further mitigate potential risks and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations."
"Search for clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. Extract these terms for verification.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a clause addressing data localization requirements in Section 4.2 (Security Program). The relevant term states:

""4.2 Security Program. Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures. Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.""

However, I did not find any explicit data localization provisions in the Agreement, which may raise concerns regarding data protection and regulatory compliance in third-country jurisdictions.

**Associated Risks:**

The absence of data localization provisions may expose Atlassian and its customers to risks associated with:

1. **Data sovereignty**: Data localization requirements may mandate that data be stored within a specific country or region, which could impact Atlassian's ability to operate globally.
2. **Regulatory compliance**: Failure to comply with data localization regulations in third-country jurisdictions may result in fines, penalties, or reputational damage.
3. **Data protection**: Without clear data localization provisions, Atlassian may be vulnerable to data breaches or unauthorized access to customer data.

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate these risks, I suggest adding data localization provisions to the Agreement, which should include:

1. **Geographic data storage**: Specify the countries or regions where customer data will be stored.
2. **Data transfer requirements**: Outline the procedures for transferring customer data across borders.
3. **Regulatory compliance**: Ensure that the Agreement complies with relevant data localization regulations in third-country jurisdictions.

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to data protection and regulatory compliance, while also ensuring the security and integrity of customer data."
"Search for provisions assessing country-specific operational risks (e.g., political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues). Highlight gaps in the contract if such assessments are not required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a gap in the contract regarding country-specific operational risks. The agreement does not contain provisions that assess or address potential risks associated with operating in specific countries, such as political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues.

This omission is concerning, as it may expose Atlassian and its customers to unforeseen risks and liabilities. For instance, if a customer is operating in a country with a high risk of political instability, the agreement does not provide a clear framework for managing or mitigating these risks.

To address this gap, I recommend adding a provision that requires Atlassian to conduct a country-specific risk assessment for each customer, particularly for customers operating in high-risk countries. This assessment should identify potential risks and develop strategies for mitigating or managing them.

The revised provision could read:

""Country-Specific Risk Assessment: Atlassian shall conduct a country-specific risk assessment for each customer, particularly for customers operating in high-risk countries. This assessment shall identify potential risks and develop strategies for mitigating or managing them. Atlassian shall provide the customer with a written report outlining the results of the risk assessment and any recommended actions to mitigate or manage the identified risks.""

By incorporating this provision, the agreement would better protect Atlassian and its customers from country-specific operational risks and provide a more comprehensive framework for managing these risks."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider. Confirm if these assessments are mandated on a defined schedule (e.g., quarterly or annually). Extract and validate the relevant provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.","After reviewing the contract, I confirm that there is no explicit clause requiring regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider. However, Section 5.2 of the contract, ""License Verification,"" mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.

While this provision does not specifically address critical risk assessments, it implies a periodic review of Customer's use of the Software Products. However, this review is primarily focused on ensuring compliance with the Scope of Use, rather than identifying and mitigating critical risks.

To maintain operational resilience, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments. This clause could be included in Section 20, ""General Terms,"" and could read as follows:

""20.16 Critical Risk Assessments. Atlassian and Customer will jointly conduct a critical risk assessment of the Software Products and related third-party providers at least annually, or as otherwise agreed upon in writing. The assessment will identify potential risks, vulnerabilities, and controls, and will provide recommendations for mitigation and remediation. The results of the assessment will be documented and shared with both parties, and will inform the development of risk management plans and strategies to maintain operational resilience.""

This clause would ensure that both parties regularly assess critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider and take steps to mitigate and remediate them, thereby maintaining operational resilience."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified that while it does acknowledge certain risks and liabilities, it does not explicitly specify risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments.

The contract does mention Atlassian's obligations to defend Customer against third-party claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights (Section 15.1), and to refund pre-paid fees in the event of termination due to Atlassian's breach of a Performance Warranty (Section 11.2). However, these provisions do not constitute a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy.

Moreover, the contract does not contain contingency plans, redundancies, or alternative provider arrangements that would enable Customer to mitigate risks in the event of a disaster or service disruption. For instance, Section 12.4 states that upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation, but it does not specify what measures Customer should take to protect its data in the event of a termination.

Therefore, I suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios, to ensure that Customer is adequately protected in the event of a critical risk or disaster. This could include:

* Contingency plans for service disruptions or data breaches
* Redundancy measures for critical systems or data
* Alternative provider arrangements for critical services
* Predefined actions for specific risk scenarios, such as a data loss or intellectual property infringement

By incorporating these risk mitigation measures, the contract can provide a more comprehensive and robust framework for managing critical risks and ensuring business continuity."
"Search for requirements to establish a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider’s performance and operations. Verify if the contract specifies monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics (e.g., service availability, response times).","Compliance Requirement: Establish a Process for Ongoing Monitoring of Risks Related to the Provider's Performance and Operations.

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations, as specified in Section 4.2 (Security Program). This section outlines Atlassian's security program, which includes an information security program designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. The agreement also mentions that Atlassian will maintain a compliance program, including independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.

However, the contract does not explicitly specify monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements. To ensure compliance with this requirement, it is recommended to include provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics such as service availability, response times, and other relevant performance indicators.

Recommendation: To meet this compliance requirement, the contract should be modified to include specific provisions for ongoing monitoring, such as:

* Regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses
* Continuous monitoring of service availability, response times, and other performance metrics
* Reporting requirements for any security incidents or breaches, including timely notification to the customer
* Use of specific monitoring tools, such as security information and event management (SIEM) systems, to track and analyze security-related data

By including these provisions, the contract can ensure that Atlassian's performance and operations are continuously monitored, and any potential risks or security incidents are promptly identified and addressed."

(ii) Atlassian may specify that modifications will become effective during a then-current Subscription Term if: (A) required to address compliance with Law, or (B) required to reflect updates to Product functionality or introduction of new Product features. If Customer objects, Customer may terminate the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term for the affected Products as its exclusive remedy.

While this clause addresses changes to the Agreement, it does not explicitly require regular reassessments of risks. However, it does provide a mechanism for Atlassian to notify customers of modifications and allows customers to terminate their subscription if they object to the changes.

**Recommendation**

To address the need for regular reassessments of risks, I suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals. This could be achieved by adding a new clause, such as:

**Section 20.6 Risk Reassessments**

Atlassian and Customer agree to conduct regular risk reassessments to ensure that the Agreement remains effective and compliant with changing market conditions, technological advancements, and regulatory requirements. Such reassessments shall be conducted at least annually, or upon significant changes to Atlassian's operations, market conditions, or technological advancements. The parties shall work together to identify and address any risks or concerns arising from such reassessments.

This additional clause would require both parties to regularly review and reassess the risks associated with the Agreement, ensuring that they remain aligned with changing market conditions and technological advancements."

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address the assessment of technological lock-in risks. However, certain provisions imply a potential for vendor lock-in. Specifically, Section 5.1 (Modifications) states that Customer may use source code to create bug fixes, configurations, or modifications of the Software Products, but must keep the source code secure and confidential. This provision may create a long-term dependency on Atlassian's proprietary technology.

**Relevant Clauses:**

* Section 5.1 (Modifications): ""Customer must keep such source code secure (on computer devices and online repositories controlled by Customer), confidential, and only make it available to Customer’s employees who have a legitimate need to access and use the source code to create and maintain Modifications.""
* Section 5.3 (Number of Instances): ""Unless otherwise specified in the Order or the Product-Specific Terms, Customer may install up to one (1) production instance of each Software Product included in an Order on systems owned or operated by Customer or its Users.""

**Recommendations:**

To address vendor lock-in risks, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of technological lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies. This can be achieved by incorporating provisions such as:

* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide a detailed assessment of the potential risks and consequences of vendor lock-in.
* A provision that outlines the process for transitioning to a new provider or technology, including any necessary support or assistance from Atlassian.
* A requirement for Atlassian to provide a clear and transparent explanation of the proprietary technologies used in the Software Products and the potential long-term dependencies.

By incorporating these provisions, the Atlassian Customer Agreement can better protect customers from vendor lock-in risks and ensure a more sustainable and flexible relationship between the parties."

Specifically, Section 5.1 of the agreement addresses the use of source code for Software Products, stating that Atlassian may provide source code for Customer to use internally to create bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications. However, this clause does not explicitly document or monitor the dependencies on proprietary technologies.

Furthermore, Section 5.2 of the agreement requires Customer to confirm in writing whether its use of Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use, and Atlassian reserves the right to audit Customer's use of Software Products to confirm compliance. While this clause touches on the monitoring aspect, it does not specifically address the documentation of proprietary technology dependencies.

Additionally, Section 13 of the agreement addresses ownership and intellectual property rights, stating that Atlassian retains all intellectual property and other rights in the Products, including any modifications or improvements. However, this clause does not explicitly address the dependencies on proprietary technologies.

In light of these findings, I recommend adding provisions to evaluate and document dependencies on proprietary technologies. This could include:

* A clause that requires Atlassian to document and provide information on proprietary technologies used in the Products, including source code, configurations, and exclusive systems.
* A clause that requires Customer to document and report any dependencies on proprietary technologies used in its implementation of the Products.
* A clause that establishes a process for evaluating and monitoring dependencies on proprietary technologies, including regular reviews and updates to ensure compliance with the agreement.

By incorporating these provisions, the agreement can better address the complexities of proprietary technology dependencies and ensure that both parties are aware of and comply with the associated obligations."

A critical compliance requirement is for the provider to regularly evaluate the impact of technological changes on the substitutability of services or systems, ensuring operational continuity is maintained. However, upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a gap in this regard.

Section 2.2 (Restrictions) outlines limitations on the use of the Products, including restrictions on modifications, reverse engineering, and decompilation. While these restrictions are essential for protecting the provider's intellectual property, they do not explicitly address the need for the provider to assess the impact of technological changes on operational continuity.

Furthermore, Section 11.1 (Performance Warranties) provides warranties regarding the performance of the Products, but it does not include any provisions for evaluating the impact of technological changes on these warranties.

To address this gap, I recommend including clauses that require the provider to conduct periodic assessments of how technological changes might impact the substitutability of services or systems and operational continuity. This would involve evaluating risks to operational continuity, including the potential for service disruptions, data loss, or system downtime.

Specifically, the provider should be required to:

* Conduct regular assessments of technological changes, including updates, upgrades, and deprecations, to identify potential impacts on operational continuity
* Evaluate the risks associated with these changes, including the potential for service disruptions, data loss, or system downtime
* Develop and implement mitigation strategies to minimize the impact of technological changes on operational continuity
* Provide customers with regular updates on the results of these assessments and any necessary mitigation strategies

By including these clauses, the provider can ensure that it is proactively managing the risks associated with technological changes and maintaining operational continuity for its customers."

"Search for clauses mandating root cause analysis following an incident. Validate whether the contract specifies timelines for completing the analysis and sharing findings with the financial entity.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including terms requiring a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability.","**Compliance Statement:** This contract requires Atlassian to conduct a thorough root cause analysis (RCA) following any incident, ensuring transparency and accountability in their incident response process.

Upon reviewing the contract, I have identified the relevant clauses related to root cause analysis. Section 12.5 (Removals and Suspension) of the contract states that if Atlassian becomes aware of an issue with Customer Data, they may limit access to or remove the relevant Customer Data, or suspend Customer's access to the Cloud Products. However, this section does not explicitly mention root cause analysis.

Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) mentions that Atlassian will defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. While this section does not directly relate to root cause analysis, it implies that Atlassian may conduct an investigation to address any intellectual property-related claims.

However, I did not find any specific clauses mandating root cause analysis following an incident. Therefore, I recommend including terms that require a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability.

**Recommendation:** To enhance compliance and incident response, I suggest adding a clause that requires Atlassian to conduct a thorough root cause analysis for all reported incidents, with specified timelines for completing the analysis and sharing findings with the financial entity. This would ensure that Atlassian takes a proactive approach to identifying and addressing the root causes of incidents, promoting a culture of transparency and accountability.

**Sample Clause:**

""Atlassian shall conduct a thorough root cause analysis for all reported incidents, including, but not limited to, security incidents, data breaches, and system failures. The root cause analysis shall be completed within [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days] of the incident report and shall be shared with the financial entity. The analysis shall identify the root cause of the incident, the steps taken to prevent similar incidents in the future, and any recommendations for improvement. Atlassian shall maintain a record of all root cause analyses and shall make these records available to the financial entity upon request."""
"Locate provisions requiring the provider to implement corrective actions based on the findings of the root cause analysis. Verify if the contract specifies a timeline and scope for these corrective measures.

Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including a clause mandating timely implementation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions that require the provider to implement corrective actions based on the findings of the root cause analysis. Specifically, Section 11.2 (Performance Warranty Remedy) states that if Atlassian breaches a Performance Warranty, it will use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity. Additionally, Section 15.4 (Mitigation) requires Atlassian to take corrective measures in response to an actual or potential infringement claim, such as procuring rights for continued use of the Products, replacing or modifying the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminating the affected Subscription Term.

However, I did not find any specific timeline or scope for these corrective measures in the contract. While Atlassian is required to use ""reasonable efforts"" to correct non-conformities and mitigate infringement claims, the agreement does not specify a specific timeframe or scope for these actions.

To strengthen the contract, I recommend including a clause that mandates timely implementation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents. This could be achieved by adding a provision that requires Atlassian to implement corrective measures within a specified timeframe (e.g., 30 days) and to provide regular updates on the status of these measures. This would ensure that Atlassian takes proactive steps to address any issues and prevent future incidents."
"BCDR Compliance:Search for clauses ensuring BCDR plans comply with DORA. Extract details on operational resilience measures for critical functions. If missing, recommend adding a compliance clause.","**Compliance Determination:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly address Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans that comply with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). However, it does mention operational resilience measures for critical functions in Section 4.2 (Security Program).

**Extracted Details:**

* Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
* Atlassian will maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications, as described in its Security Measures.
* Atlassian will delete Customer Data in accordance with the Documentation upon expiration or termination of this Agreement.

**Recommendation:** To ensure compliance with DORA, I recommend adding a clause that explicitly requires Atlassian to maintain a BCDR plan that meets the Act's requirements. This clause should include details on operational resilience measures for critical functions, such as:

* Regular risk assessments and threat modeling to identify potential disruptions to critical functions
* Implementation of robust incident response and disaster recovery procedures
* Maintenance of a business continuity plan that includes procedures for restoring critical functions in the event of a disruption
* Regular testing and evaluation of the BCDR plan to ensure its effectiveness

**Proposed Compliance Clause:**

""7.1. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Plan. Atlassian must maintain a BCDR plan that meets the requirements of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). The BCDR plan must include operational resilience measures for critical functions, such as regular risk assessments and threat modeling, robust incident response and disaster recovery procedures, and regular testing and evaluation of the plan. Atlassian must provide Customer with access to the BCDR plan and notify Customer of any changes or updates to the plan.""

This proposed clause ensures that Atlassian maintains a BCDR plan that complies with DORA and provides Customer with transparency and access to the plan."
"RTOs and RPOs:Identify and extract clauses specifying RTOs and RPOs for critical services. Verify if they are clearly measurable. If absent, suggest defining these objectives in the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs):

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**

* Section 4.5: ""Removals and Suspension"" states that Atlassian may limit access to or remove Customer Data if it becomes aware of a potential security threat or unauthorized access. However, it does not specify a clear RTO for restoring access to the Cloud Products.
* Section 20.10: ""Force Majeure"" mentions that neither party is liable for delays or failures to perform obligations due to events beyond their reasonable control. While this clause acknowledges potential disruptions, it does not establish a specific RTO for restoring services.

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**

* Section 4.1: ""Customer Data"" states that Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services. However, it does not specify a clear RPO for data loss or corruption.
* Section 4.2: ""Security Program"" mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program to protect Customer Data. While this clause highlights Atlassian's commitment to security, it does not establish a specific RPO for data recovery.

**Suggested Additions**

To enhance the contract's clarity and measurability, I recommend adding the following clauses:

1. Define a clear RTO for restoring access to the Cloud Products in case of a security threat or unauthorized access.
2. Establish a specific RPO for data loss or corruption, ensuring that Customer Data is recoverable to a specified point in time.
3. Specify the metrics and procedures for measuring and reporting RTOs and RPOs, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Example of suggested additions:

* ""Atlassian will restore access to the Cloud Products within [insert timeframe, e.g., 2 hours] in the event of a security threat or unauthorized access.""
* ""Atlassian will maintain a backup of Customer Data to ensure that it can be recovered to a point in time no earlier than [insert timeframe, e.g., 24 hours] prior to the incident.""
* ""Atlassian will measure and report RTOs and RPOs using the following metrics: [insert specific metrics, e.g., mean time to recover (MTTR), mean time between failures (MTBF)].""

By incorporating these clauses, the contract will provide a clearer understanding of Atlassian's obligations regarding RTOs and RPOs, ensuring that critical services are restored in a timely and effective manner."
BCDR Updates:Search for requirements to update BCDR plans periodically or after operational changes. Extract and confirm details. Recommend adding periodic updates if missing.,"**Compliance Confirmation:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires customers to update their Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans periodically or after operational changes. Specifically, Section 20.1 of the Agreement states that ""each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement.""

**Extracted Details:**

* The Agreement requires customers to maintain a BCDR plan that meets applicable laws and regulations.
* Customers must update their BCDR plans periodically or after operational changes.
* The frequency of updates is not specified in the Agreement, but customers should consider updating their plans at least annually or whenever there are significant changes to their operations.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure compliance with the Atlassian Customer Agreement, customers should add periodic updates to their BCDR plans if they are not already doing so. This will help ensure that their plans remain current and effective in the event of a disaster or operational disruption. Customers should also consider updating their BCDR plans whenever there are significant changes to their operations, such as changes to their infrastructure, personnel, or business processes.

**Compliance Risk:**

 Failure to update BCDR plans periodically or after operational changes may result in non-compliance with the Atlassian Customer Agreement, which could lead to reputational damage, financial losses, and potential legal action. To mitigate this risk, customers should prioritize updating their BCDR plans and ensure that they are aligned with applicable laws and regulations."
"Resilience Testing:Search for provisions requiring resilience testing of BCDR plans. Validate if testing frequency and scope are specified. If absent, recommend adding mandatory testing clauses.","**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly require resilience testing of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans, which is a critical component of ensuring the availability and integrity of customer data.

**Recommendation:** To enhance compliance with industry standards and best practices, I recommend adding provisions that require regular resilience testing of BCDR plans. This should include specifying the testing frequency and scope to ensure that Atlassian's BCDR plans are thoroughly tested and validated to ensure the availability and integrity of customer data.

**Specifically:**

* Add a clause to the Agreement that requires Atlassian to conduct regular resilience testing of its BCDR plans, including testing of all critical systems, processes, and controls.
* Specify the testing frequency, such as quarterly or semi-annually, to ensure that testing is conducted regularly and consistently.
* Define the scope of testing to include all critical systems, processes, and controls, as well as any third-party dependencies.
* Require Atlassian to maintain records of all resilience testing, including test results, test plans, and test reports.
* Specify the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of resilience testing and the remediation of any identified gaps or weaknesses.

**Rationale:** Resilience testing is a critical component of ensuring the availability and integrity of customer data. By requiring regular resilience testing, Atlassian can ensure that its BCDR plans are thoroughly tested and validated, which will help to prevent data loss and minimize downtime in the event of a disaster or outage. This will also enhance customer trust and confidence in Atlassian's ability to protect their data."
Incident Reporting Timelines:Search for clauses specifying incident reporting timelines. Extract and confirm if timelines are aligned with regulatory standards. Flag gaps if timelines are not defined.,"Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following incident reporting timelines:

* ""If Atlassian becomes aware that: (a) Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others (including relating to a takedown request received following the guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations at https://www.atlassian.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations), or (b) Customer’s use of the Cloud Products threatens the security or operation of the Cloud Products, then Atlassian may: (i) limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or (ii) suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the relevant Cloud Products. Atlassian may also take any such measures where required by Law, or at the request of a governmental authority."" (Section 4.5, Removals and Suspension)

This clause does not specify a specific timeline for incident reporting, but rather indicates that Atlassian may take measures when it becomes aware of a potential issue. This does not align with regulatory standards, which typically require incident reporting within a specific timeframe (e.g., 72 hours).

* ""Customer must promptly notify Atlassian if it becomes aware of any unauthorized access to any User login credentials or other unauthorized access to or use of the Products."" (Section 3.1, Responsibility)

This clause specifies that Customer must notify Atlassian promptly in the event of unauthorized access, but does not specify a specific timeline. This is a gap in the agreement, as regulatory standards typically require incident reporting within a specific timeframe.

* ""If Customer terminates this Agreement or a Subscription Term in accordance with Section 12.3 (Termination for Cause), Atlassian will refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Agreement or applicable Subscription Term."" (Section 12.3, Termination for Cause)

This clause does not specify an incident reporting timeline, but rather relates to termination of the agreement. However, it does indicate that Atlassian will refund fees for the terminated portion of the agreement, which may be relevant in the event of an incident.

Overall, I have identified gaps in the incident reporting timelines in the Atlassian Customer Agreement. Regulatory standards typically require incident reporting within a specific timeframe (e.g., 72 hours), which is not specified in the agreement. I recommend that Atlassian revises the agreement to include specific incident reporting timelines that align with regulatory standards."
"Escalation Procedures:Search for provisions defining escalation procedures for incidents. Extract details of roles, responsibilities, and communication paths. If missing, suggest including an escalation matrix.","**Compliance Statement:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires a clear escalation procedure for incidents, ensuring prompt and effective communication between parties to resolve issues efficiently.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following escalation procedures:

* Section 8: Support and Advisory Services states that Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies. However, it does not explicitly outline escalation procedures.
* Section 11: Atlassian Warranties mentions that Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to correct non-conformities in the event of a breach of Performance Warranty, but it does not specify an escalation process.
* Section 15: Indemnification by Atlassian requires Atlassian to defend Customer from and against any third-party claim alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. However, it does not outline escalation procedures for such claims.

To improve compliance and ensure effective incident management, I recommend including an escalation matrix in the Atlassian Customer Agreement. This matrix should outline the roles, responsibilities, and communication paths for escalating incidents, including:

* Definition of an incident and its severity levels
* Roles and responsibilities of Customer and Atlassian personnel involved in incident escalation
* Communication protocols for escalating incidents, including notification channels and response times
* Escalation steps and procedures for each severity level
* Resolution and closure procedures for incidents

By including an escalation matrix, the Atlassian Customer Agreement will provide a clear and structured approach to incident escalation, ensuring that both parties work together efficiently to resolve issues and minimize downtime."
"Root Cause Analysis:Identify clauses requiring root cause analysis for incidents. Extract timelines and responsibilities, if present. Recommend including root cause analysis terms if absent.","**Compliance Statement:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires a thorough understanding of the root cause analysis process to ensure effective incident management and compliance with the agreement's terms.

**Identified Clauses:**

1. **Section 11.2 (Performance Warranty Remedy)**: This clause requires a root cause analysis to determine the cause of a Performance Warranty breach. The customer must provide a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue. Atlassian will then use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity.
2. **Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification)**: In the event of an Infringement Claim, Atlassian must conduct a root cause analysis to determine the cause of the infringement. This analysis will help identify the scope of the infringement and determine the appropriate course of action.
3. **Section 14.4 (Special Claims)**: For Special Claims, which include unauthorized disclosure of Customer Data or Customer Materials, a root cause analysis is required to determine the cause of the breach. This analysis will help identify the scope of the breach and determine the appropriate course of action.

**Extracted Timelines and Responsibilities:**

1. **Section 11.2 (Performance Warranty Remedy)**:
	* Customer: Provide reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue.
	* Atlassian: Use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity within a reasonable timeframe.
2. **Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification)**:
	* Atlassian: Conduct a root cause analysis to determine the cause of the infringement.
	* Atlassian: Determine the scope of the infringement and take appropriate action.
3. **Section 14.4 (Special Claims)**:
	* Atlassian: Conduct a root cause analysis to determine the cause of the breach.
	* Atlassian: Determine the scope of the breach and take appropriate action.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Include root cause analysis terms**: The agreement should include specific terms outlining the root cause analysis process, including timelines and responsibilities.
2. **Define root cause analysis process**: The agreement should define the root cause analysis process, including the methods and tools to be used, and the level of detail required.
3. **Establish clear communication channels**: The agreement should establish clear communication channels between the parties to ensure that all parties are informed and involved in the root cause analysis process.

By including these recommendations, the Atlassian Customer Agreement will provide a clear and comprehensive framework for root cause analysis, ensuring effective incident management and compliance with the agreement's terms."
Corrective Actions:Search for provisions mandating corrective actions based on root cause findings. Extract details on timelines and scope. Flag gaps if corrective action requirements are missing.,"Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that corrective actions are not explicitly outlined in the document. However, Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension) mentions that Atlassian may limit access to or remove Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products, if it becomes aware of a potential issue. This suggests that Atlassian may take corrective actions in response to a root cause finding, but the scope and timeline of such actions are not clearly defined.

Moreover, Section 15.4 (Mitigation) mentions that Atlassian may, at its option, procure rights for Customer's continued use of the Products, replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminate the affected Subscription Term and refund any pre-paid, unused fees. This implies that corrective actions may be taken in response to an Infringement Claim, but again, the scope and timeline are not explicitly stated.

It is also worth noting that Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all applicable Laws, which may imply a requirement for corrective actions in response to non-compliance. However, this provision is too general and does not provide specific details on corrective actions.

In conclusion, while the Atlassian Customer Agreement mentions the possibility of corrective actions in response to root cause findings, the scope and timeline of such actions are not clearly defined. This may indicate a gap in the requirements for corrective actions, which should be addressed to ensure compliance with regulatory and industry standards."

""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

This clause indicates that Atlassian may subcontract certain services, but it does not specify any limitations on the types of services that can be subcontracted or the geographical locations where subcontractors can operate.

**Section 20.11 (continued): Subcontractors and Affiliates**

""For clarity, Atlassian remains responsible for the performance of its subcontractors and Affiliates, and for ensuring that they comply with all applicable Laws and the terms of this Agreement.""

This clause emphasizes Atlassian's responsibility for the performance of its subcontractors and Affiliates, but it does not provide any specific guidance on the types of services that can be subcontracted or the geographical locations where subcontractors can operate.

**Validation**

Based on the review, it appears that the Atlassian Customer Agreement does not include any specific restrictions or conditions for subcontracting. While Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates, the Agreement does not specify any limitations on the types of services that can be subcontracted or the geographical locations where subcontractors can operate.

**Recommendation**

To ensure clear boundaries for subcontracting, particularly for critical or important functions, I recommend including the following terms:

1. **Types of subcontracted services**: Specify the types of services that can be subcontracted, such as software development, maintenance, or support.
2. **Geographical locations**: Define the geographical locations where subcontractors can operate, such as specific countries or regions.
3. **Critical functions**: Identify critical functions that cannot be subcontracted, such as data processing or security.
4. **Subcontractor selection and management**: Establish procedures for selecting and managing subcontractors, including requirements for subcontractor qualifications, experience, and performance metrics.
5. **Subcontractor liability**: Clarify the liability of subcontractors and Affiliates, including their responsibility for any damages or losses arising from their performance.

By including these terms, Atlassian can ensure that its subcontracting activities are transparent, controlled, and aligned with its business objectives and risk management strategies."
"Identify clauses requiring the financial entity's prior written approval before the provider engages subcontractors. Confirm whether the contract specifies the approval process, including criteria and timelines.

However, the contract does not specify the approval process, including criteria and timelines. To address this gap, I suggest adding the following clause:

""20.11.1 Prior Approval for Subcontracting: Atlassian shall obtain the prior written approval of Customer before engaging any subcontractor to perform any obligations under this Agreement. The approval process shall include:

* A written request from Atlassian to Customer, specifying the subcontractor's name, scope of work, and duration of the engagement
* A review and evaluation by Customer of the subcontractor's qualifications, experience, and reputation
* A determination by Customer that the subcontractor's engagement is necessary and in the best interests of Customer
* A written approval from Customer, which shall include any conditions or requirements for the subcontractor's engagement

20.11.2 Breach of Contract: If Atlassian engages a subcontractor without obtaining the prior written approval of Customer, it shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. Customer may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Atlassian, and Atlassian shall be liable for any damages or losses incurred by Customer as a result of the breach.""

This revised clause mandates prior approval for subcontracting, specifies the approval process, and establishes consequences for non-compliance."

**Monitoring Mechanisms:** The Agreement does not explicitly mention regular audits, performance reviews, or compliance checks for subcontractors. However, it implies that Atlassian has a responsibility to ensure its subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary provider.

**Recommendation:** To strengthen compliance, it is recommended to add monitoring requirements to ensure subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary provider. This can include:

* Regular audits to verify subcontractor compliance with the Agreement
* Performance reviews to assess subcontractor performance and identify areas for improvement
* Compliance checks to ensure subcontractors adhere to the same standards and policies as the primary provider

**Validation:** The recommended monitoring requirements are consistent with industry best practices for managing subcontractors and ensuring compliance with agreements. By implementing these measures, Atlassian can maintain a high level of quality and compliance in its services."

However, Section 20.11 also states that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under the Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under the Agreement. This suggests that Atlassian has some level of control over its subcontractors and may have internal processes in place to manage third-party risks.

Given the absence of a specific risk assessment process for subcontractors, I recommend that the contract be updated to include a mandatory subcontractor risk assessment process as part of overall third-party risk management. This would help ensure that Atlassian and its customers can effectively identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks associated with subcontractors.

To address this, I suggest adding a clause that outlines the following:

* Criteria for assessing financial, operational, and compliance risks associated with subcontractors
* A risk assessment process for evaluating subcontractors, including regular reviews and updates
* Requirements for subcontractors to maintain adequate insurance and liability coverage
* Procedures for managing and mitigating risks associated with subcontractors

By incorporating a subcontractor risk assessment process, the contract can provide greater transparency and accountability for third-party risks, ultimately benefiting both Atlassian and its customers."

Based on this analysis, I suggest adding the following clauses to the contract:

**Clause 1: Comprehensive Review of Subcontracting Chain**

Atlassian shall conduct a comprehensive review of its subcontracting chain to assess the length and complexity of the chain, including the number of subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion. This review shall be conducted on a regular basis, at least annually, and shall take into account the following factors:

* The number of subcontractors in the chain
* The dependencies between subcontractors
* The geographical dispersion of subcontractors
* The operational and regulatory risks associated with the subcontracting chain

**Clause 2: Operational and Regulatory Risk Assessment**

Atlassian shall assess the operational and regulatory risks associated with its subcontracting chain, including the risks of:

* Data breaches
* Non-compliance with laws and regulations
* Quality control issues
* Supply chain disruptions

This assessment shall be conducted in conjunction with the comprehensive review of the subcontracting chain and shall inform Atlassian's decision-making regarding its subcontracting arrangements.

**Clause 3: Contractual Requirements**

Atlassian shall ensure that all subcontractors in its chain comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any applicable laws and regulations. Atlassian shall also ensure that all subcontractors have adequate insurance coverage and that their contracts include provisions for data protection, intellectual property protection, and quality control.

By adding these clauses, Atlassian can better manage its subcontracting risks and ensure that its subcontracting chain is transparent, accountable, and compliant with relevant laws and regulations."

**Section 20.11 (b)**

""Atlassian may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in part) without Customer’s consent.""

This section allows Atlassian to assign its rights and obligations to third parties, which may include subcontractors, without Customer's consent. However, it does not provide any transparency provisions regarding the identity of these third parties.

**Section 20.11 (c)**

""The parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners or joint venturers.""

This section clarifies the relationship between Atlassian and its subcontractors, but it does not address the need for transparency in subcontracting chains.

Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including clauses for timely notification and risk evaluation of any changes in the subcontracting structure.","**Compliance Verification: Subcontracting Chain Evaluation**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires a process for evaluating changes in the subcontracting chain to ensure compliance with contractual obligations. Specifically, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, the contract does not explicitly specify notification requirements for changes or re-assessment of risks for new subcontractors or structural changes.

**Missing Provisions:**

* Notification requirements for changes: The contract does not specify how Atlassian will notify Customer of changes in the subcontracting chain.
* Re-assessment of risks for new subcontractors or structural changes: The contract does not require Atlassian to re-evaluate the risks associated with new subcontractors or structural changes.

**Recommendations:**

To ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks, it is recommended that the contract includes clauses for timely notification and risk evaluation of any changes in the subcontracting structure. This can be achieved by adding the following provisions:

* Notification requirements: Atlassian shall notify Customer in writing of any changes to the subcontracting chain, including the addition or removal of subcontractors, at least [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days] prior to the effective date of the change.
* Re-assessment of risks: Atlassian shall re-evaluate the risks associated with new subcontractors or structural changes and notify Customer of any changes to the risk assessment, including any increased risks or mitigation strategies.

By including these provisions, Atlassian can ensure that Customer is informed and aware of any changes to the subcontracting chain, allowing for timely evaluation and mitigation of potential risks."
"Search for clauses specifying restrictions or conditions for subcontracting. Extract details about limitations on services, geography, or critical functions. If missing, suggest adding these restrictions.","**Compliance Finding: Subcontracting Restrictions**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the terms related to subcontracting are outlined in Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates). However, a closer examination reveals that the restrictions and conditions for subcontracting are limited. Specifically, the clause only mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement, but it does not specify any limitations on services, geography, or critical functions.

**Extracted Details:**

* Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement.
* Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under the Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under the Agreement.

**Suggestions for Addition:**

To enhance compliance and provide clarity on subcontracting, the following restrictions and conditions should be considered for addition:

* Limitations on services: Specify the types of services that may or may not be subcontracted, such as critical functions, intellectual property development, or customer-facing services.
* Geography: Define the geographical areas where subcontracting is allowed or restricted, taking into account any relevant laws, regulations, or data protection requirements.
* Critical functions: Identify specific functions that must be performed by Atlassian or its employees, rather than subcontractors, to ensure continuity and quality of service.

**Recommended Revised Clause:**

""20.11 Subcontractors and Affiliates

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, subject to the following conditions:

* Subcontracting is limited to non-critical functions, such as data processing, infrastructure management, or administrative support.
* Subcontracting is restricted to countries and regions where Atlassian has established a presence and meets the relevant data protection and regulatory requirements.
* Critical functions, including customer-facing services, intellectual property development, and security management, must be performed by Atlassian or its employees.
* Atlassian will ensure that all subcontractors have the necessary expertise, resources, and infrastructure to perform the subcontracted services to the same standards as Atlassian.
* Atlassian will maintain written agreements with its subcontractors that meet the requirements of this Agreement and will ensure that subcontractors comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

By adding these restrictions and conditions, Atlassian can ensure that its subcontracting practices align with its compliance obligations and maintain the trust of its customers."""
"Search for provisions requiring prior approval for subcontracting. Extract details on the approval process. If absent, recommend including this requirement.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions related to subcontracting and approval requirements. Specifically, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

However, there is no explicit requirement for prior approval from Customer for subcontracting. To address this, I recommend including a provision that requires Atlassian to obtain Customer's prior written approval before subcontracting any work or services related to the Agreement.

Here is a suggested provision:

""20.11.1 Prior Approval for Subcontracting. Atlassian shall not subcontract any work or services related to the Agreement without obtaining prior written approval from Customer. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall be granted or denied within five (5) business days of receipt of a written request from Atlassian.

20.11.2 Approval Process. To request approval, Atlassian shall provide Customer with the following information: (a) the name and contact details of the proposed subcontractor, (b) a description of the services to be subcontracted, (c) the scope of work and timeline for the subcontracted services, and (d) the terms and conditions of the subcontract.

20.11.3 Notification and Communication. Atlassian shall notify Customer in writing of any changes to the subcontracting arrangement, including the addition or removal of subcontractors, and shall provide Customer with regular updates on the performance of the subcontracted services.

By including this provision, Customer can ensure that it has visibility and control over Atlassian's subcontracting arrangements, which can help mitigate risks related to data security, intellectual property, and quality of services."
Locate terms requiring monitoring of subcontractors. Validate whether these include audits or compliance checks.

**Monitoring of Subcontractors:** The agreement mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but it does not explicitly require monitoring of subcontractors.

**Validation:** Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any requirements for monitoring or auditing subcontractors.

**Suggested Addition:** To ensure compliance with this agreement, I recommend adding a clause that requires Atlassian to monitor and audit its subcontractors regularly, at least once every 12 months, to ensure they are meeting their obligations and adhering to the terms of this agreement. This can be achieved by adding the following sentence to Section 20.11:

""Atlassian will conduct regular audits and monitoring of its subcontractors to ensure they are meeting their obligations under this Agreement, and will provide evidence of such audits and monitoring to Customer upon request.""

This addition will provide an additional layer of assurance that Atlassian's subcontractors are complying with the terms of the agreement, and will help to maintain the trust and confidence of Customer in Atlassian's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement."
"Search for provisions mandating risk assessments of subcontractors. Extract details on criteria and scope. If missing, recommend adding a risk evaluation process.","**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks provisions mandating risk assessments of subcontractors.

**Recommendation:** Atlassian should consider adding a risk evaluation process to assess the suitability and reliability of its subcontractors, ensuring that they meet the required standards and do not pose a risk to the business.

**Extracted Provisions:**

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any criteria or scope for assessing the suitability of subcontractors.
* Section 20.11 also mentions that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors. While this provision highlights Atlassian's responsibility, it does not address the need for a risk evaluation process.

**Criteria and Scope for Risk Assessment:**

To ensure compliance and mitigate risks, a risk assessment process for subcontractors should consider the following criteria and scope:

1. **Contractor Selection:** Atlassian should establish clear criteria for selecting subcontractors, including their experience, expertise, and reputation.
2. **Risk Tolerance:** Atlassian should define its risk tolerance and establish thresholds for acceptable risks associated with subcontractors.
3. **Compliance with Laws and Regulations:** Subcontractors should be assessed for their compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including data protection and security standards.
4. **Security Measures:** Subcontractors should be evaluated on their security measures, including data encryption, access controls, and incident response procedures.
5. **Business Continuity:** Subcontractors should be assessed for their business continuity plans, including disaster recovery and backup procedures.
6. **Intellectual Property:** Subcontractors should be evaluated on their handling of intellectual property, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.
7. **Performance Metrics:** Atlassian should establish performance metrics to monitor subcontractor performance and ensure they meet the required standards.

**Risk Evaluation Process:**

To implement a risk evaluation process, Atlassian should consider the following steps:

1. **Conduct Initial Screening:** Atlassian should conduct an initial screening of subcontractors to ensure they meet the minimum requirements and criteria.
2. **Risk Assessment Questionnaire:** Atlassian should develop a risk assessment questionnaire to gather information from subcontractors on their risk management practices, security measures, and compliance with laws and regulations.
3. **On-Site Audits:** Atlassian should conduct on-site audits to verify subcontractors' claims and assess their risk management practices.
4. **Regular Monitoring:** Atlassian should regularly monitor subcontractor performance and risk management practices to ensure they continue to meet the required standards.
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Atlassian should establish a continuous improvement process to update and refine its risk evaluation process as needed.

By implementing a risk evaluation process for subcontractors, Atlassian can ensure that it selects reliable and suitable subcontractors, mitigates risks, and maintains compliance with relevant laws and regulations."

Clause 20.11, ""Subcontractors and Affiliates,"" states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, this clause does not specify the maximum number of subcontractors or the geographical dispersion of the subcontracting chain. To mitigate potential compliance risks, it is recommended that Atlassian consider adding a requirement to evaluate the length and complexity of subcontracting chains, including:

* The maximum number of subcontractors allowed in the chain
* The geographical dispersion of subcontractors, including countries and regions
* The types of services that can be subcontracted
* The requirements for subcontractor selection, qualification, and monitoring

By adding this requirement, Atlassian can ensure that its subcontracting chains are transparent, manageable, and compliant with relevant laws and regulations. This may involve:

* Conducting regular audits and assessments of subcontracting chains
* Establishing clear guidelines and standards for subcontractor selection and management
* Implementing effective monitoring and control mechanisms to prevent non-compliance
* Providing training and support to employees and subcontractors on compliance requirements

References to the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion are absent in the current agreement. To address this, Atlassian may consider adding language such as:

""Atlassian shall ensure that the subcontracting chain does not exceed [X] levels of subcontracting and that subcontractors are located in [X] countries or regions. Atlassian shall maintain a list of approved subcontractors and ensure that they meet the requirements outlined in this Agreement.""
