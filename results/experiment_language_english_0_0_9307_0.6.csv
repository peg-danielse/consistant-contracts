"Search for explicit clauses stating that the financial entity retains full responsibility for DORA compliance. Look specifically for:
 - Clear statements of retained responsibility
 - References to DORA obligations
 - Non-transfer of compliance obligations
 - Acknowledgment that outsourcing doesn't diminish entity's responsibility","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have found the following explicit clauses that address the financial entity's retained responsibility for DORA compliance:

**Retained Responsibility**

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that ""Each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement."" This implies that the financial entity retains full responsibility for complying with DORA obligations.
* Section 20.1 also mentions that ""Customer must comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products."" This suggests that the financial entity is responsible for ensuring compliance with export and import regulations, which may be relevant to DORA.

**References to DORA Obligations**

* Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) does not explicitly mention DORA, but it refers to ""all Laws applicable to its business,"" which would include DORA regulations.
* Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) mentions ""third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party."" While not directly related to DORA, this clause implies that the financial entity is responsible for ensuring that its use of the Products does not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights, which may be relevant to DORA.

**Non-Transfer of Compliance Obligations**

* Section 20.3 (Assignment) states that ""Customer may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or an Order without Atlassian's prior written consent."" This implies that the financial entity cannot transfer its compliance obligations to Atlassian or any other third party.
* Section 20.3 also mentions that ""Atlassian may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in part) without Customer's consent."" This suggests that Atlassian may retain some responsibility for compliance, but the financial entity remains primarily responsible.

**Acknowledgment that Outsourcing Doesn't Diminish Entity's Responsibility**

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This implies that while Atlassian may outsource certain tasks, it remains responsible for ensuring that its subcontractors comply with DORA obligations.

In summary, the Atlassian Customer Agreement explicitly states that the financial entity retains full responsibility for complying with DORA obligations, references DORA regulations, and acknowledges that outsourcing does not diminish the entity's responsibility."

* Government end-user requirements: The agreement includes a specific clause for government end-users, outlining the terms and conditions of the agreement (Section 20.14).

**Non-Delegation of Regulatory Responsibilities**

Atlassian has not delegated its regulatory responsibilities to any third-party entity, ensuring that it remains accountable for compliance with all applicable financial services laws.

**Clear Acknowledgment of Ongoing Regulatory Obligations**

The agreement acknowledges that Atlassian's obligations under the agreement are ongoing and that it will continue to comply with all applicable financial services laws during the term of the agreement.

**References to Specific Financial Services Laws**

The agreement references specific financial services laws, including:

* The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods (Section 20.4)
* U.S. export laws (Section 20.13)
* Government end-user requirements (Section 20.14)

**Recommendation**

Given the comprehensive coverage of financial services laws in the agreement, it is not necessary to add an explicit clause covering retention of regulatory responsibilities. However, it is recommended that Atlassian consider including a clause that explicitly states its commitment to ongoing compliance with all applicable financial services laws, ensuring that its responsibilities are clearly documented and understood by all parties involved."

Follow-up if Missing: Flag as continuity gap and suggest adding comprehensive transition planning requirements.","**Compliance Review: Service Continuity during Transition**

It is imperative that service continuity is ensured during transition to prevent disruptions and maintain business operations. A thorough review of transition plan components, timeline requirements, resource allocation, knowledge transfer, and data migration procedures is crucial to guarantee a seamless transition.

**Transition Plan Components**

The transition plan should include a detailed description of the transition process, including the roles and responsibilities of key personnel, timelines, and milestones. It should also outline the communication plan, risk management strategy, and contingency planning. Additionally, the plan should specify the criteria for measuring the success of the transition.

**Timeline Requirements**

A realistic and achievable timeline should be established to ensure that the transition is completed within the agreed-upon timeframe. The timeline should include key milestones, deadlines, and critical path activities. It is essential to build in buffers for unexpected delays and to allow for flexibility in case of changes.

**Resource Allocation**

Sufficient resources, including personnel, equipment, and budget, should be allocated to ensure the successful completion of the transition. This includes identifying and assigning the necessary personnel with the required skills and expertise to manage the transition.

**Knowledge Transfer**

Knowledge transfer is a critical component of the transition plan. It involves ensuring that key knowledge, skills, and expertise are transferred from the outgoing team to the incoming team. This includes documenting processes, procedures, and systems, as well as providing training and support to the new team.

**Data Migration Procedures**

Data migration procedures should be carefully planned and executed to ensure that all data is accurately and completely transferred from the old system to the new system. This includes identifying data sources, data mapping, data validation, and data testing.

**Compliance Gap: Comprehensive Transition Planning Requirements**

In light of the review, it is recommended that comprehensive transition planning requirements be added to ensure service continuity during transition. This includes:

* A detailed transition plan that outlines roles, responsibilities, timelines, and milestones
* A realistic and achievable timeline with key milestones and deadlines
* Sufficient resource allocation, including personnel, equipment, and budget
* Effective knowledge transfer and documentation of processes, procedures, and systems
* Careful planning and execution of data migration procedures

By addressing these compliance gaps, organizations can ensure a seamless transition and maintain business operations, ultimately reducing the risk of disruptions and service continuity issues."
