"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","**Compliance Assessment:** The contract does not explicitly address the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider, indicating a potential gap in the agreement.

The contract mentions the customer's responsibility to determine whether the products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use (Section 6.2). However, there is no specific clause that addresses the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider.

**Extracted Clauses:**

* Section 6.2: ""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use.""

**Gap Identification:**

The contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and defining criteria for determining substitutability. This would ensure that the customer has a clear understanding of the provider's substitutability and can make informed decisions about their service selection and procurement.

**Recommendation:**

The contract should be revised to include a clause that addresses the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. This could be achieved by adding a section that outlines the criteria for determining substitutability, such as:

* Section X.Y: ""The customer shall assess the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider by evaluating the following criteria: [insert criteria, e.g., compatibility with existing systems, scalability, security, etc.]""

This would ensure that the contract addresses the substitutability of the provider and provides a clear framework for the customer to evaluate their service selection and procurement."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","The contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. However, based on industry standards, possible benchmarks for substitutability assessments could include:

* Technical compatibility: ensuring that the substitute product meets the same technical specifications and requirements as the original product.
* Operational complexity: evaluating the ease of transition from the original product to the substitute product, including factors such as data migration, system integration, and training requirements.
* Cost: considering the total cost of ownership, including upfront costs, ongoing maintenance, and support expenses.
* Performance: assessing the substitute product's performance, including its speed, scalability, and reliability.

To enhance the contract's clarity and ensure effective substitutability assessments, I recommend adding measurable criteria, such as:

* Technical specifications: listing specific requirements, such as hardware, software, and networking standards.
* Ease of transition: outlining the process and timeline for migrating from the original product to the substitute product.
* Cost evaluation: defining the criteria for evaluating the total cost of ownership, including cost-benefit analysis and return on investment (ROI) calculations.

By incorporating these measurable criteria, the contract can provide a clear framework for substitutability assessments, ensuring that both parties understand the expectations and requirements for substituting products."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","Compliance Observation: The contract does not explicitly require documentation of alternative providers in the market.

Upon reviewing the contract, I found that Section 10.2(b) mentions that if Customer is required to withhold tax from payment to Atlassian in certain jurisdictions, Customer must provide valid documentation it receives from the taxing authority in such jurisdictions confirming remittance of withholding. However, this section does not mention documentation of alternative providers.

There is no requirement to maintain a list of alternative providers in the market. Section 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business, but this section does not specifically address documentation of alternative providers.

Recommendation: To improve compliance, I suggest including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This clause can be added to Section 20 (General Terms) or as a separate section. For example:

""20.16 Market Scanning: Customer agrees to conduct regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers of [insert specific products or services]. Customer will maintain a list of these alternatives and provide it to Atlassian upon request. The list must include, at a minimum, the following information: [insert specific requirements, such as provider name, contact information, and product/service offerings].""

This clause will ensure that Customer is regularly assessing the market and documenting alternative providers, which can help Atlassian to better understand the competitive landscape and make informed decisions."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I confirm that there are no provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. However, I note that the Agreement does require customers to conduct a review of their use of the Products and related Support or Advisory Services at the end of each Subscription Term (Section 10.3). This review involves assessing whether the Products meet the customer's requirements and regulatory obligations, but it does not specifically require a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers.

I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility. This could include provisions such as:

* A periodic review of the customer's use of the Products and related Support or Advisory Services to assess whether it is still meeting their needs and whether alternative providers are available that may offer better value (Section 10.3);
* A requirement for the customer to consider alternative providers when renewing a Subscription Term, including assessing their costs, operational requirements, and strategic fit (Section 10.1);
* A provision that allows the customer to terminate the Agreement without penalty if they determine that an alternative provider is more cost-effective or better meets their needs (Section 12.2).

By incorporating these provisions, the Agreement would require customers to regularly evaluate their use of the Products and related Support or Advisory Services, consider alternative providers, and make informed decisions about their strategic flexibility."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a clause that is relevant to maintaining awareness of market alternatives.

**Compliance Statement:** Atlassian's customer agreement requires customers to be aware of their obligations to comply with laws and regulations, as well as to ensure they have made all necessary disclosures and obtained all necessary rights and consents to use Atlassian's products and services.

**Extracted Provision:** Section 6.1 of the agreement states: ""Customer must ensure it has made all disclosures and obtained all rights and consents necessary for Atlassian to use Customer Data and Customer Materials to provide the Cloud Products, Support or Advisory Services.""

**Validation:** This provision implies that customers are responsible for being aware of their obligations and for ensuring that they have taken the necessary steps to comply with relevant laws and regulations. However, it does not explicitly require customers to conduct periodic market research or reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.

**Recommendation:** To flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews, I suggest adding a clause that requires customers to regularly assess their use of Atlassian's products and services in light of emerging market alternatives. This could be done by adding a new section to the agreement, such as:

**New Provision:** ""6.2 Periodic Market Reviews. Customer agrees to regularly review and assess its use of Atlassian's products and services in light of emerging market alternatives. This review shall be conducted at least annually and shall include an evaluation of the customer's use of Atlassian's products and services in comparison to similar products and services offered by competitors. Customer shall provide Atlassian with written notice of any changes to its use of Atlassian's products and services as a result of this review.""

This new provision would require customers to take a proactive approach to evaluating emerging market alternatives and to regularly assess their use of Atlassian's products and services in light of these alternatives."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","Based on the contract, it appears that Atlassian requires customers to confirm compliance with their scope of use for Software Products upon request. Section 5.2 states that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use, provided Atlassian gives Customer reasonable advance notice and uses reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Customer.

However, there is no explicit requirement for customers to assess existing arrangements with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. This is a potential gap, as customers may have multiple contracts or arrangements with Atlassian that are not being regularly reviewed or assessed.

It is recommended that Atlassian include a requirement for periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider, to ensure that customers are aware of their obligations and to prevent potential non-compliance. This could be achieved by adding a clause to the contract that requires customers to:

* Conduct regular reviews of all existing contracts with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements
* Provide Atlassian with written confirmation of their compliance with the scope of use for each Software Product
* Update their scope of use and notify Atlassian of any changes to their arrangements

By including this requirement, Atlassian can ensure that customers are aware of their obligations and are taking steps to comply with the contract terms, which can help to prevent potential disputes or non-compliance issues."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","**Compliance Assessment:**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the contract does not explicitly require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Specifically, Section 7.2 mentions the use of third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services, or products (Third-Party Products) with the Products, but it does not explicitly require the evaluation of risks associated with these connected providers.

**Flagged Absence:**

The absence of provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers in the Atlassian Customer Agreement highlights a potential compliance risk. To mitigate this risk, I suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers in the contract.

**Recommended Provision:**

Consider adding a provision similar to the following:

""7.2. Connected Providers: Customer shall evaluate and manage the risks associated with Third-Party Products used with the Products. Customer shall assess the relationships with connected providers, including their reputation, security, and compliance practices, to ensure that they do not pose a risk to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Customer Data.""

By including this provision, the contract would require Atlassian customers to evaluate and manage the risks associated with connected providers, ensuring a more robust compliance framework."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","**Compliance Observation:** The contract does not explicitly require the evaluation of concentration risk, but it does imply the need for dependency tracking on a single provider.

**Key Clauses:**

* Section 10.1(e) mentions that Atlassian may bill Customer's credit card or online payment method for renewals, additional orders, and unpaid fees, which implies that Customer relies on Atlassian for multiple services.
* Section 12.3 (Termination for Cause) mentions that either party may terminate the agreement if the other party ceases operation without a successor, which suggests that Customer may be vulnerable to a single provider's failure.
* Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) requires Customer to comply with applicable export and import laws, which implies that Customer may need to track dependencies on Atlassian for multiple services.

**Recommendation:** While the contract does not explicitly require concentration risk evaluation, it is essential to track dependency on Atlassian for multiple services. I recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks, such as:

* Identifying the services and data that are dependent on Atlassian
* Evaluating the potential impact of Atlassian's failure or insolvency on Customer's business
* Developing a mitigation plan to reduce concentration risk, such as diversifying providers or implementing backup systems
* Regularly reviewing and updating the mitigation plan to ensure it remains effective

By adding this section, Customer can proactively manage concentration risk and ensure business continuity in the event of Atlassian's failure or insolvency."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","Compliance Review: Interdependencies between Third-Party Services.

Provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider are not explicitly stated in the provided Agreement. However, Section 7.2, ""Third-Party Products,"" mentions that use of Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider. 

It is recommended to include a provision that requires an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This assessment would help identify potential risks and ensure that appropriate measures are taken to mitigate them."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have found no clauses that explicitly require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk.

Compliance requirement: An assessment of the provider's market share and concentration risk is not present in the agreement, which may leave the customer exposed to potential monopoly risks and limited alternatives.

Gap: The agreement does not address the potential risks associated with provider dominance, such as reduced competition, limited innovation, and increased vulnerability to market fluctuations. To address this gap, it is recommended that the agreement be modified to include terms that require the provider to disclose its market share and concentration risk, and for the customer to evaluate and address these risks in its procurement decisions."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","**Geographical Concentration Risks Assessment:**

Upon reviewing the contract, I confirm that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. Specifically, the contract does not address risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters. This omission raises concerns regarding the provider's ability to manage and mitigate potential risks associated with geographical concentration.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I recommend including a geographical risk assessment clause in the contract. This clause should outline the provider's approach to assessing and mitigating risks related to geographical concentration, including:

* Infrastructure reliability and availability
* Natural disasters and extreme weather events
* Regulatory and compliance risks associated with specific locations
* Supply chain disruptions and logistics risks

By incorporating a geographical risk assessment clause, the contract can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the provider's risk management strategies and ensure that both parties are aware of potential risks and associated mitigation measures."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","**Compliance Statement:**
Atlassian's contractual obligations with its customers, as outlined in the Atlassian Customer Agreement, require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Extracted Provisions:**

* Section 4.2 (Security Program): Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. Atlassian will also maintain a compliance program that includes independent third-party audits and certifications.
* Section 4.1 (Customer Data): Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement. This implies that Atlassian is responsible for ensuring the protection of Customer Data in accordance with EU data protection regulations.
* Section 6.3 (Sensitive Health Information and HIPAA): Customer must not upload to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to process) any patient, medical, or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This provision indirectly requires Atlassian to comply with EU data protection regulations when processing sensitive health information.

**Validation:**
These provisions demonstrate that Atlassian has taken steps to ensure compliance with EU data protection regulations, specifically the GDPR, when processing Customer Data. The security program, customer data processing, and sensitive health information provisions all indicate a commitment to protecting personal data in accordance with EU standards.

**Flagged Absence and Suggested Inclusion:**
Although the agreement includes provisions related to data protection, it does not explicitly state that third-country providers must comply with EU data protection regulations. To ensure compliance with the GDPR, it is recommended that the agreement include a provision explicitly requiring third-country providers to adhere to EU data protection regulations. For example:

""Third-country providers providing services to Customer under this Agreement must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any other applicable EU data protection regulations, including the principles of data protection by design and by default, data minimization, and data subject rights.""

This addition would ensure that third-country providers are held to the same standards as EU-based providers, providing a higher level of data protection for Customer Data."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that assess the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, specifically in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance:

* Clause 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) indicates that the Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland or the State of California, depending on the customer's domicile. This clause may not adequately account for variations in law enforcement effectiveness across different jurisdictions.
* Clause 20.5 (Notices) outlines the process for providing notices under the Agreement, which may not be effective in jurisdictions with inadequate law enforcement or regulatory frameworks.
* Clause 20.1 (Compliance with Laws) requires each party to comply with all applicable Laws, but does not provide specific guidance on how to assess or mitigate legal risks associated with law enforcement in the provider's country.

To address the recommendation to add specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider's country, I suggest the following:

* Clause 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) could be modified to include a provision that takes into account the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's country, such as:
	+ ""The parties acknowledge that the laws and regulations of [provider's country] may not be effective in enforcing this Agreement, and the parties agree to take reasonable steps to mitigate any potential risks associated with law enforcement in [provider's country].""
* Clause 20.5 (Notices) could be modified to include a provision that addresses the challenges of providing notices in jurisdictions with inadequate law enforcement, such as:
	+ ""In the event that a notice is required to be provided under this Agreement, the parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the notice is delivered in a timely and effective manner, taking into account the laws and regulations of [provider's country].""
* A new clause could be added to specifically address the assessment of legal risks in the provider's country, such as:
	+ ""The parties agree to conduct a regular assessment of the legal risks associated with law enforcement in [provider's country], including but not limited to, the effectiveness of the country's laws and regulations, the availability of dispute resolution mechanisms, and the responsiveness of law enforcement authorities. The parties will take reasonable steps to mitigate any potential risks identified in the assessment and will work together to develop strategies to address any challenges that arise.""

By incorporating these provisions, the Agreement can better account for the complexities of law enforcement in the provider's country and provide a more effective framework for ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance."
"Search for clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions. Extract these terms for verification.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs.","**Compliance Verification: Data Localization Requirements and Associated Risks**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses addressing data localization requirements and associated risks in third-country jurisdictions:

**Clause 4.1: Customer Data**

""Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement.""

**Clause 4.2: Security Program**

""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure, as described in its Security Measures.""

**Clause 14.4: Special Claims**

""For Special Claims, Atlassian’s aggregate liability under this Agreement will be the lesser of: (a) two times (2x) the amounts paid to Atlassian for the Products, Support and Advisory Services giving rise to the Special Claim during the twelve (12) months preceding the first event out of which the Special Claim arose, and (b) US$5,000,000. “Special Claims” means any unauthorized disclosure of Customer Data or Customer Materials caused by a breach by Atlassian of its obligations in Section 4.2 (Security Program).""

**Clause 16: Confidentiality**

""Atlassian's Confidential Information includes any source code and technical or performance information about the Products. Customer's Confidential Information includes Customer Data and Customer Materials.""

**Clause 20.13: Export Restrictions**

""The Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions. Customer must comply with all applicable export and import Laws in its access to, use of, and download of the Products or any content or records entered into the Products.""

While these clauses provide some guidance on data localization requirements and associated risks, I recommend adding explicit data localization provisions to align with regulatory and operational needs. This will ensure that Atlassian's data processing practices comply with relevant laws and regulations, and minimize the risk of non-compliance in third-country jurisdictions."
"Search for provisions assessing country-specific operational risks (e.g., political instability, legal uncertainties, or infrastructure issues). Highlight gaps in the contract if such assessments are not required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified that there are no provisions assessing country-specific operational risks. This is a significant gap in the contract, as it leaves Atlassian exposed to potential risks associated with operating in various countries with different regulatory environments, infrastructure, and political stability.

Specifically, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) states that the contract is governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of California if the customer is domiciled elsewhere. However, this provision does not account for the potential operational risks associated with conducting business in these countries.

In particular, the contract does not address potential risks such as:

* Political instability: The contract does not provide any provisions for managing risks associated with political instability, such as changes in government policies, conflicts, or economic sanctions.
* Legal uncertainties: The contract does not provide any provisions for managing risks associated with legal uncertainties, such as changes in laws, regulations, or court decisions that may impact Atlassian's operations.
* Infrastructure issues: The contract does not provide any provisions for managing risks associated with infrastructure issues, such as power outages, internet connectivity problems, or other disruptions that may impact Atlassian's operations.

To address these gaps, I recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract. This could be done by including a provision that requires Atlassian to assess the operational risks associated with conducting business in each country where it operates, and to take steps to mitigate those risks. This could include:

* Conducting regular risk assessments to identify potential operational risks associated with conducting business in each country.
* Developing risk mitigation strategies to address these risks, such as implementing backup systems, diversifying suppliers, or investing in local infrastructure.
* Reviewing and updating the contract as necessary to reflect changes in the operational risks associated with conducting business in each country.

By adding this provision, Atlassian can better manage its operational risks and ensure that it is prepared to adapt to changing circumstances in each country where it operates."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.","**Compliance Finding:** The contract does not explicitly require regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider, which is a critical control for maintaining operational resilience.

**Extracted Provisions:** Section 5.2, ""License Verification"", mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. However, this provision does not specifically address the assessment of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider.

**Validation:** Upon reviewing the contract, I found that there is no explicit requirement for periodic critical risk assessments. While Section 5.2 mentions a limited audit, it does not cover the assessment of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider.

**Recommendation:** To maintain operational resilience, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments on a defined schedule (e.g., quarterly or annually). This will ensure that Customer can identify and mitigate potential risks associated with the ICT third-party provider, thereby reducing the risk of business disruption or financial loss.

**Suggested Clause:** Consider adding the following clause to the contract:

""Critical Risk Assessment: Customer shall conduct a critical risk assessment of the ICT third-party provider at least once per year, and in any case where there is a material change to the provision of the Products or Services. The assessment shall be conducted in accordance with a methodology approved by Customer and shall identify and document any critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider. Customer shall provide Atlassian with a copy of the assessment report and shall work with Atlassian to implement any mitigation measures identified in the report."""
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","The contract does specify risk mitigation measures for certain risks, but they are limited to intellectual property infringement and data breaches. Specifically, Section 15 (Indemnification by Atlassian) outlines Atlassian's obligations to defend Customer against intellectual property infringement claims and to indemnify Customer against damages resulting from such claims. Additionally, Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions Atlassian's implementation of a security program to protect Customer Data, but it does not provide explicit details on contingency plans or redundancies in the event of a data breach.

However, the contract does not explicitly address other critical risks, such as system downtime, data loss, or business continuity. Furthermore, the measures outlined in the contract are not necessarily actionable, as they do not provide clear guidance on what specific actions Atlassian will take in the event of a risk scenario.

To mitigate this risk, I suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios, to the contract. This could include:

* Contingency plans for system downtime, data loss, or business continuity disruptions
* Redundancy measures for critical systems or processes
* Alternative provider arrangements for critical services
* Clear procedures for incident response and risk management

By incorporating these measures, the contract can provide a more comprehensive framework for managing and mitigating critical risks, ensuring that both parties are better prepared to respond to potential issues."

Furthermore, Section 8 (Support and Advisory Services) mentions that Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies, but it does not specify any requirements for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations. 

Therefore, I recommend including provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics (e.g., service availability, response times), to ensure that Atlassian's performance and operations are regularly assessed and addressed. This could be achieved by adding a clause to the agreement that outlines the frequency and scope of monitoring, as well as the tools and metrics to be used."

Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals.","**Compliance Observation:** This Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks specific provisions for regular reassessment of risks, making it essential to implement a dynamic risk management framework to ensure the customer's interests are protected in light of changing market conditions, technological advancements, or the provider's operations.

Upon reviewing the agreement, I extracted the following relevant clauses:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) mentions that Customer must not use the Products to develop a similar or competing product or service, but this clause does not specifically address the need for regular risk reassessments.
* Section 4.2 (Security Program) outlines Atlassian's information security program, which includes independent third-party audits and certifications. However, this clause does not explicitly require regular reassessments of risks.
* Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. While this clause implies some level of monitoring, it does not specifically address regular risk reassessments.
* Section 10.1 (Fees) and Section 10.2 (Taxes) outline payment terms and tax obligations, but these clauses do not address the need for regular risk reassessments.

To address the compliance concern, I recommend adding a clause that requires regular reassessments of risks, such as:

**Proposed Addition:**

""**Regular Risk Reassessments:** Customer and Atlassian agree to conduct regular risk reassessments at fixed intervals (e.g., annually or bi-annually) or triggered by significant changes in the provider's operations, market conditions, or technological advancements. These reassessments will be used to identify and mitigate potential risks and ensure that the customer's interests are protected.""

This proposed addition would provide a clear framework for regular risk reassessments, enabling both parties to stay informed and adapt to changing circumstances."
"Search for provisions addressing the assessment of technological lock-in risks, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies. Extract relevant clauses.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies.","As a compliance officer, I have identified provisions addressing the assessment of technological lock-in risks in the Atlassian Customer Agreement.

The agreement highlights the potential risks associated with technological lock-in, particularly when using proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies. Article 5.1, ""Modifications"", specifically addresses the use of source code and technical modifications by Customer, stating that ""Customer must keep such source code secure (on computer devices and online repositories controlled by Customer), confidential, and only make it available to Customer's employees who have a legitimate need to access and use the source code to create and maintain Modifications.""

Additionally, Article 5.2, ""License Verification"", provides for Atlassian's ability to audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use, which may involve evaluating the risk of technological lock-in. However, it does not explicitly address the assessment of lock-in risks or potential exit strategies.

To address this gap, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies. This could be achieved by incorporating language similar to the following:

""Customer acknowledges that use of the Products may involve proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies that may create risks of technological lock-in. To mitigate these risks, Customer shall, prior to the commencement of a Subscription Term, conduct a thorough evaluation of the potential risks associated with using the Products, including the difficulty of switching providers due to proprietary technologies or long-term dependencies. Customer shall specify potential exit strategies in the event of a termination of this Agreement, including procedures for transferring or replacing proprietary technologies or dependencies.""

This additional language would require Customer to proactively assess and mitigate the risks of technological lock-in, providing a more comprehensive approach to managing these risks."
"Identify clauses assessing proprietary technology dependencies, such as the use of custom software, unique configurations, or exclusive systems. Validate if these dependencies are documented and monitored.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that assess proprietary technology dependencies:

* Section 5.1: ""Modifications"" - This clause allows Atlassian to provide source code for Customer to use internally to create bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications of the Software Products.
* Section 13: ""Ownership"" - This clause specifies that Atlassian retains all intellectual property and other rights in the Products, including any modifications or improvements.

However, I have not found any explicit documentation or monitoring provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies. To address this, I recommend adding provisions to the agreement, such as:

* Section 5.1: ""Modifications"" - Add a requirement for Customer to document and report any modifications made to the Software Products, including the source code, configurations, or other changes.
* Section 13: ""Ownership"" - Add a provision requiring Atlassian to provide notice to Customer of any proprietary technology dependencies, including custom software, unique configurations, or exclusive systems.

After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses that require an assessment of resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations.

**Extracted Provisions:**

1. **Section 4.2 (Security Program)**: Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
	* This provision implies that Atlassian has a security program in place, which may involve resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific data centers or teams.
2. **Section 9 (Ordering Process and Delivery)**: Atlassian may suspend Customer's rights to use Products or receive Support or Advisory Services if payment is overdue, and Atlassian has given Customer no fewer than ten (10) days' written notice.
	* This provision suggests that Atlassian may rely on specific teams or processes to manage payment and delivery, which could lead to resource concentration risks.
3. **Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates)**: Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

**Validation:**

These provisions are relevant to the compliance requirement of assessing resource concentration risks, as they indicate potential dependencies on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations. However, they do not explicitly require an assessment of these risks.

**Recommendation:**

To address this compliance requirement, I suggest adding requirements to evaluate and address risks from resource concentration, such as:

* Conducting a risk assessment to identify potential resource concentration risks, such as reliance on specific teams, data centers, or geographical locations.
* Developing strategies to mitigate these risks, such as diversifying dependencies or implementing backup processes.
* Regularly reviewing and updating the risk assessment to ensure that resource concentration risks are adequately addressed.

Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data, or suspend Customer’s or any User’s access to the Cloud Products if it becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others. Atlassian will give Customer the opportunity to remedy the issue before taking any such measures.

**Section 15.1: IP Indemnification**

Atlassian must defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Products, when used by Customer as authorized by this Agreement, infringe any intellectual property right of a third party. Atlassian will provide Customer with prompt written notice of any such claim.

The incident reporting timelines in these sections are as follows:

* Section 4.5: Not explicitly stated, but Atlassian must give Customer the opportunity to remedy the issue before taking any measures.
* Section 15.1: Atlassian must provide Customer with ""prompt written notice"" of any third-party claim.

**Alignment with Regulatory Standards**

Regulatory standards for incident reporting timelines vary by jurisdiction. However, in general, incident reporting timelines should be reasonable and proportionate to the risk posed by the incident.

In this case, the incident reporting timelines in the Atlassian Customer Agreement are not explicitly defined, which may not align with regulatory standards. For example, in the European Union, incident reporting timelines are typically 72 hours for security incidents and 24 hours for data breaches.

**Flagged Gaps**

The following gaps have been identified:

* Incident reporting timelines are not explicitly defined in Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension).
* The definition of ""prompt written notice"" in Section 15.1 (IP Indemnification) is not clearly defined, which may not provide sufficient clarity on incident reporting timelines.

To align with regulatory standards, I recommend that Atlassian consider adding explicit incident reporting timelines to the agreement, such as:

* For security incidents: Atlassian will notify Customer within 72 hours of becoming aware of the incident.
* For data breaches: Atlassian will notify Customer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the breach.

These timelines should be adjusted according to the specific regulatory requirements applicable to Atlassian's operations."
"Escalation Procedures:Search for provisions defining escalation procedures for incidents. Extract details of roles, responsibilities, and communication paths. If missing, suggest including an escalation matrix.","**Compliance Finding:** The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks clear escalation procedures for incidents, potentially leading to delayed or ineffective issue resolution.

**Recommended Action:** Atlassian should consider including a clear escalation matrix in the agreement, outlining the roles, responsibilities, and communication paths for incident escalation. This matrix should specify the following:

* Roles: Define the roles and responsibilities of Customer Support, Atlassian Support, and other stakeholders involved in incident escalation.
* Escalation Steps: Outline the step-by-step escalation process, including the triggers for escalation and the communication protocols to be followed.
* Communication Paths: Specify the communication channels and contact information for each role involved in incident escalation.

**Example Escalation Matrix:**

| Incident Severity | Customer Support | Atlassian Support | Next Steps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | Respond within 1 hour, escalate to Atlassian Support | Respond within 30 minutes, assign incident to a dedicated support engineer | Resolve incident within 4 hours |
| High | Respond within 2 hours, escalate to Atlassian Support | Respond within 1 hour, assign incident to a dedicated support engineer | Resolve incident within 8 hours |
| Medium | Respond within 4 hours, escalate to Atlassian Support | Respond within 2 hours, assign incident to a dedicated support engineer | Resolve incident within 24 hours |
| Low | Respond within 8 hours, escalate to Atlassian Support | Respond within 4 hours, assign incident to a dedicated support engineer | Resolve incident within 48 hours |

By including a clear escalation matrix, Atlassian can ensure timely and effective incident resolution, minimizing the impact on customers and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction."
"Root Cause Analysis:Identify clauses requiring root cause analysis for incidents. Extract timelines and responsibilities, if present. Recommend including root cause analysis terms if absent.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clause requiring root cause analysis for incidents:

**Section 11.2: Performance Warranty Remedy**

If Atlassian breaches a Performance Warranty and Customer makes a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue, Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity. If Atlassian determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the affected Subscription Term. Atlassian will then refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.

Here, the clause requires a root cause analysis to determine the non-conformity and identify the cause of the breach. The timelines for this process are as follows:

* Customer must make a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue.
* Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity within a timeframe not specified in the Agreement.

Responsibilities are as follows:

* Customer is responsible for making a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue.
* Atlassian is responsible for using reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity.

I recommend including root cause analysis terms in the Agreement to clarify the following:

* The process for identifying the root cause of a Performance Warranty breach.
* The timelines for conducting the root cause analysis.
* The responsibilities of both parties in conducting the root cause analysis.
* The consequences of failing to conduct a root cause analysis in a timely manner.

Including these terms will provide clarity and ensure that both parties understand their obligations and responsibilities in conducting a root cause analysis for incidents."

Upon reviewing the provided agreement, I have identified provisions related to corrective actions, which are primarily outlined in Section 12.5 (Survival). However, I have found that these provisions do not specifically mandate corrective actions based on root cause findings, but rather focus on the survival of certain sections of the agreement upon termination. 

The agreement does not explicitly state the timelines for implementing corrective actions or specify the scope of such actions. Furthermore, there is no clear indication of the responsibility for implementing corrective actions or the mechanism for tracking and verifying their completion. As a result, I have flagged gaps in the corrective action requirements, highlighting the need for more detailed provisions to ensure effective compliance with regulatory requirements."

According to this clause, Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

**Extracted Clauses:**

* ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""
* ""Atlassian will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its subcontractors will comply with all applicable Laws and will not compromise Atlassian's ability to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

**Validation:**

The extracted clauses appear to be sufficient to establish clear boundaries for subcontracting, including:

* Atlassian's responsibility for its subcontractors' performance
* Requirement for written agreements with subcontractors
* Compliance with applicable Laws
* Maintenance of Atlassian's ability to meet its obligations under the Agreement

However, it is recommended to include additional terms that define clear boundaries for subcontracting, particularly for critical or important functions, such as:

* Limitations on types of subcontracted services (e.g., sensitive data processing, high-risk activities)
* Geographical locations where subcontracting is permitted (e.g., restricted to certain countries or regions)
* Critical functions that must be performed by Atlassian or its direct employees, rather than subcontractors

These additional terms would help to ensure that subcontracting is carried out in a responsible and controlled manner, aligning with the Agreement's overall objectives."

**Approval Process:** The contract does not specify the approval process, including criteria and timelines, for the provider to engage subcontractors.

**Gap Highlight and Suggestion:** To mitigate the risk of unauthorized subcontracting, I suggest adding the following clause:

**Proposed Clause:** 20.11.1 (Prior Approval for Subcontracting)

Prior to engaging any subcontractors or Affiliates, the Provider must obtain the Financial Entity's prior written approval. Such approval must be obtained at least [insert timeframe, e.g., 10 business days] prior to the subcontractor's engagement. The Provider must provide the Financial Entity with the subcontractor's details, including their qualifications, experience, and proposed scope of work. The Financial Entity reserves the right to reject any proposed subcontractor or impose additional conditions on their engagement.

**Breaches:** The Provider's failure to obtain prior written approval for subcontracting constitutes a material breach of this Agreement, which may result in termination or other penalties as specified in Section 12 (Term and Termination).

By incorporating this clause, the contract ensures that the financial entity has visibility and control over the provider's subcontracting activities, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized subcontracting and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements."

**Validation:** Upon closer examination, Section 20.11 does not explicitly mention regular audits, performance reviews, or compliance checks for subcontractors. However, it implies that Atlassian should have written agreements in place with subcontractors to ensure compliance with its obligations.

**Recommendation:** To ensure subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary provider, I recommend adding monitoring requirements to the agreement, such as:

* Regular audits of subcontractors' performance and compliance with Atlassian's standards
* Performance reviews to ensure subcontractors meet or exceed Atlassian's service level agreements
* Compliance checks to verify subcontractors adhere to Atlassian's policies and procedures

These added provisions would strengthen the agreement and provide an additional layer of assurance for customers that subcontractors are held to the same high standards as the primary provider."

While the contract does mention that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the agreement (Section 20.11), it does not provide any guidelines or criteria for assessing the risks associated with these subcontractors.

In order to mitigate potential risks, I recommend that the organization include a mandatory subcontractor risk assessment process as part of its overall third-party risk management framework. This process should cover the following:

* Financial risks: Assess the subcontractor's financial stability, creditworthiness, and ability to meet its obligations.
* Operational risks: Evaluate the subcontractor's operational capabilities, experience, and track record.
* Compliance risks: Review the subcontractor's compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards.

By incorporating a subcontractor risk assessment process into the contract, the organization can ensure that it has a robust framework in place to manage the risks associated with subcontractors and protect its interests."

Upon reviewing the contract, it appears that there is no specific requirement for assessing the length and complexity of subcontracting chains. Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the contract, but it does not provide any guidance on how to evaluate the risks associated with subcontracting chains.

To address this gap, I recommend adding clauses to the contract that mandate a comprehensive review of subcontracting chain length and complexity. This review should consider the following factors:

* Number of subcontractors: The contract should require Atlassian to identify and assess the risks associated with each subcontractor, including their reputation, financial stability, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
* Dependencies: The contract should require Atlassian to evaluate the dependencies between subcontractors and identify any potential risks or vulnerabilities in the subcontracting chain.
* Geographical dispersion: The contract should require Atlassian to consider the geographical dispersion of subcontractors and assess the risks associated with managing subcontractors in different jurisdictions.

Example of proposed clause:

""Atlassian shall conduct a comprehensive review of the subcontracting chain length and complexity prior to engaging any subcontractor. This review shall consider the number of subcontractors, dependencies between subcontractors, and geographical dispersion. Atlassian shall identify and assess the risks associated with each subcontractor, including their reputation, financial stability, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

Upon reviewing the agreement, I found that clause 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) only mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations, but it does not specify any restrictions or conditions on subcontracting. This lack of specificity may lead to unforeseen consequences, such as:

* Unclear limitations on services: The agreement does not specify which services Atlassian can subcontract or which services must be performed by Atlassian directly.
* Unrestricted geography: The agreement does not limit the geography where subcontractors can be based or where services can be performed, potentially exposing Atlassian to data protection and other regulatory risks.
* Unclear critical functions: The agreement does not specify which critical functions or services cannot be subcontracted, potentially undermining the reliability and security of the Products and related Support and Advisory Services.

To mitigate these risks, I recommend adding the following subcontracting restrictions to the agreement:

* Specify which services Atlassian can subcontract and which services must be performed by Atlassian directly.
* Limit subcontracting to specific geographic regions or countries, ensuring compliance with data protection and other regulatory requirements.
* Identify critical functions or services that cannot be subcontracted, ensuring that Atlassian maintains control over essential aspects of the Products and related Support and Advisory Services.
