"Search the contract for any mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. Extract clauses that address whether the provider is easily substitutable or not. If no such clauses are found, note the absence and flag it as a gap.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Indicate that the contract should include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and recommend defining criteria for determining substitutability.","Upon reviewing the contract, I have found that there is no explicit mention of an assessment regarding the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. This absence is flagged as a gap in the contract.

However, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) of the contract does mention that the customer is responsible for ensuring that the products are used in accordance with the applicable scope of use, and that any modifications or use of the products for purposes other than those specified in the scope of use may be subject to additional fees or restrictions. This suggests that the customer has some flexibility in using the products, but it does not directly address the substitutability of the provider.

Additionally, Section 20.13 (Export Restrictions) of the contract mentions that the products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, and that the customer must comply with all applicable export and import laws. This provision does not directly address substitutability, but it does suggest that the customer may need to consider the provider's ability to comply with export and import regulations when evaluating their substitutability.

Overall, the contract does not provide clear guidance on assessing the substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider. To address this gap, I recommend that the contract include provisions for assessing the substitutability of the provider and define criteria for determining substitutability. This could include factors such as:

* The provider's ability to meet the customer's current and future needs
* The provider's technical capabilities and infrastructure
* The provider's experience and expertise in the relevant field
* The provider's ability to comply with relevant laws and regulations
* The provider's reputation and reliability

By including these provisions, the contract can provide a clear framework for evaluating the substitutability of the provider and ensure that the customer is able to make informed decisions about their ICT services."
"Identify whether the contract defines specific criteria for determining substitutability (e.g., technical compatibility, operational complexity). If criteria are unclear or missing, suggest possible benchmarks based on industry standards.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments, such as cost, technical specifications, and ease of transition.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it appears that the contract does not explicitly define specific criteria for determining substitutability. The agreement mentions that Customer may increase its Scope of Use by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order, but it does not provide clear guidelines for assessing substitutability.

To address this gap, I recommend adding measurable criteria for substitutability assessments. Possible benchmarks based on industry standards could include:

1. Cost: The cost of the new product or service compared to the existing one, including any additional costs associated with implementation, training, or support.
2. Technical specifications: The technical requirements and specifications of the new product or service, including compatibility with existing systems, infrastructure, and data formats.
3. Ease of transition: The ease of transitioning from the existing product or service to the new one, including the complexity of the migration process, the amount of training required, and the potential impact on business operations.
4. Functional equivalence: The degree to which the new product or service meets the same functional requirements as the existing one, including any differences in features, performance, or user experience.
5. Vendor support: The level of support provided by the vendor for the new product or service, including the availability of documentation, training, and technical support.

By incorporating these criteria, Atlassian can provide a more comprehensive and transparent framework for assessing substitutability, enabling customers to make informed decisions about their product or service choices.

Recommendation:

* Add a new section to the agreement that outlines the criteria for substitutability assessments, including cost, technical specifications, ease of transition, functional equivalence, and vendor support.
* Provide clear definitions and guidelines for each criterion to ensure consistency and accuracy in assessments.
* Consider establishing a process for regular review and update of the substitutability criteria to ensure they remain relevant and effective over time."
"Search the contract for clauses requiring documentation of alternative providers in the market. Verify if these alternatives are listed or if there is a requirement to maintain such a list. Highlight missing documentation requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers.","**Compliance Verification: Documentation of Alternative Providers**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to documentation of alternative providers:

* Section 7.2: ""Third-Party Products. Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”).""
* Section 20.11: ""Subcontractors and Affiliates. Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

However, I have not found any clauses requiring the documentation of alternative providers in the market. Specifically, there is no requirement to:

* Maintain a list of alternative providers
* Regularly scan the market to identify alternative providers
* Document the market scan results
* Compare the performance or quality of Atlassian's products with those of alternative providers

To address this gap, I recommend including a clause mandating regular market scans to identify and document alternative providers. This would ensure that Atlassian maintains a competitive edge and can demonstrate compliance with market requirements.

**Recommendation:**

* Add a new clause to the agreement, such as:
""20.12. Market Scanning. Atlassian shall regularly scan the market to identify and document alternative providers that offer similar products or services to those provided by Atlassian. The results of these market scans shall be documented and maintained by Atlassian for a period of [insert timeframe].""

This clause would require Atlassian to:

* Regularly scan the market to identify alternative providers
* Document the results of these market scans
* Maintain the documentation for a specified timeframe

By including this clause, Atlassian can demonstrate its commitment to maintaining a competitive edge and complying with market requirements."
"Search for provisions requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. Confirm whether the analysis considers financial, operational, and strategic factors.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to maintain strategic flexibility.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I confirm that there is no explicit provision requiring a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. However, Section 10.1 (Fees) mentions that Atlassian may specify that modifications to the Agreement will take effect during a then-current Subscription Term if required to address compliance with Law or to reflect updates to Product functionality or introduction of new Product features. This suggests that Atlassian may consider alternative providers or solutions when updating its products or services.

However, the Agreement does not explicitly require a cost-benefit analysis of alternative providers. To maintain strategic flexibility, I suggest adding requirements for regular cost-benefit analyses to ensure that Atlassian considers financial, operational, and strategic factors when evaluating alternative providers. This could include:

* Conducting regular cost-benefit analyses to assess the value of Atlassian's products and services compared to those of alternative providers
* Evaluating the financial, operational, and strategic implications of switching to alternative providers
* Considering the impact on customer relationships, business continuity, and overall strategic goals
* Documenting the results of the cost-benefit analysis and using it to inform future business decisions

By incorporating these requirements, Atlassian can ensure that it remains competitive and adaptable in the market, while also maintaining a strong focus on customer needs and strategic objectives."
"Look for any clauses specifying the need to maintain awareness of market alternatives (e.g., through periodic market research). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and recommend adding provisions for periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clause that relates to maintaining awareness of market alternatives:

**Section 6.2. Product Assessment**

""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer’s requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use.""

This clause does not explicitly require periodic market research or reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. However, it does imply that the customer has a responsibility to assess the products and ensure they meet their needs.

**Validation**

While the clause does not explicitly require periodic market reviews, it does suggest that the customer should be aware of their requirements and regulatory obligations. This implies that the customer should be aware of market alternatives and emerging trends that may impact their needs.

**Recommendation**

To address the potential gap, I recommend adding a provision that requires periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives. This could be included in a new clause, such as:

**Section 6.3. Market Awareness**

""Customer agrees to conduct periodic market reviews to evaluate emerging alternatives and assess whether the Products continue to meet their requirements and regulatory obligations. Customer will provide Atlassian with reasonable access to information related to these reviews, upon request.""

This new clause would require the customer to maintain awareness of market alternatives and emerging trends, and to provide Atlassian with access to information related to these reviews. This would help ensure that the customer is aware of potential alternatives and can make informed decisions about their use of the Products."
"Search the contract for requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. Confirm whether this includes the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. Highlight gaps if no such assessment is required.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider.","**Compliance Requirement:**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, it is clear that there are no explicit requirements to assess existing arrangements with the same provider. However, Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use, provided Atlassian gives Customer reasonable advance notice and uses reasonable efforts to minimize disruption to Customer.

**Gap in Requirements:**

The contract does not explicitly require a comprehensive assessment of existing arrangements with the same provider, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements. This is a significant gap, as it may lead to inconsistencies and potential non-compliance with the terms of the new agreement.

**Recommendation:**

To address this gap, I recommend including periodic reviews of all existing contracts with the provider. This will ensure that the Customer's existing arrangements are aligned with the new agreement and that any changes or updates are properly documented and implemented. This can be achieved by adding a clause to the contract that requires the Customer to conduct a thorough review of all existing arrangements with the provider, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements, and to provide a report to Atlassian outlining any changes or updates that need to be made to ensure compliance with the new agreement.

**Sample Language:**

The Customer agrees to conduct a thorough review of all existing arrangements with Atlassian, including the number, type, and scope of such arrangements, and to provide a report to Atlassian outlining any changes or updates that need to be made to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The Customer shall conduct this review within [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days] of the effective date of this Agreement and shall provide the report to Atlassian within [insert timeframe, e.g., 60 days] of completing the review."
"Search for provisions requiring the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Verify whether these relationships are identified and documented in the contract.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including requirements to evaluate risks from connected providers.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision related to the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers. Section 7.2, ""Third-Party Products,"" states that Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (""Third-Party Products""). However, this section does not explicitly require the assessment of relationships with closely connected providers.

To ensure compliance, I recommend including a requirement to evaluate risks from connected providers. This can be achieved by adding a provision that requires Customer to assess the risks associated with using Third-Party Products and to document these assessments.

Specifically, I suggest adding the following provision:

""7.2.1 Assessment of Connected Providers. Customer acknowledges that Third-Party Products may be developed or provided by closely connected providers. Customer must assess the risks associated with using Third-Party Products and document these assessments. Customer must also ensure that it has a clear understanding of the terms and conditions of the Third-Party Products, including any data sharing or confidentiality obligations.""

This provision would require Customer to evaluate the risks associated with using Third-Party Products and to document these assessments, ensuring that Customer has a clear understanding of the terms and conditions of the Third-Party Products.

Additionally, I recommend that Atlassian provide guidance on how to assess the risks associated with using Third-Party Products, including the following:

* Identifying closely connected providers
* Evaluating the risks associated with using Third-Party Products
* Documenting these assessments
* Ensuring compliance with data sharing and confidentiality obligations

By including this provision and providing guidance on how to assess the risks associated with using Third-Party Products, Atlassian can ensure that Customer is aware of the potential risks and takes necessary steps to mitigate them."
"Identify clauses that mandate evaluating the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services. Validate if the contract requires tracking dependency on the provider.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding a section to analyze and address concentration risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses that may be relevant to evaluating concentration risk:

1. **Section 20.13: Export Restrictions**: This clause requires the customer to comply with all applicable export and import laws, including restrictions on exporting or re-exporting the Products or any direct product of the Products to certain jurisdictions or parties. This may imply a concentration risk if the customer relies heavily on a single provider for multiple services.
2. **Section 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates**: This clause allows Atlassian to use subcontractors or its affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement. While this clause does not explicitly mention concentration risk, it may imply a risk if the customer relies on a single subcontractor or affiliate for multiple services.
3. **Section 9: Ordering Process and Delivery**: This clause specifies that Atlassian may deliver login instructions or license keys for Products electronically, which may imply a concentration risk if the customer relies on a single method of delivery for multiple services.

However, I did not find any explicit clauses that require tracking dependency on the provider or mandate evaluating concentration risk. To address this, I recommend adding a section to the contract that explicitly addresses concentration risk and requires the customer to evaluate and mitigate this risk.

**Recommendation:**

* Add a new section to the contract, e.g., ""Concentration Risk Management,"" that requires the customer to:
	+ Evaluate the concentration risk of relying on a single provider for multiple services.
	+ Identify and track dependencies on the provider.
	+ Develop a plan to mitigate concentration risk, including diversifying services or providers.
	+ Regularly review and update the concentration risk management plan to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

This additional section would help ensure that the customer is aware of the concentration risk and takes steps to mitigate it, thereby reducing the risk of disruption to their business operations."
"Search for provisions assessing interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Extract these clauses if present.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision that assesses interdependencies between services provided by the third-party provider. Specifically, Section 7.2 states:

""7.2. Third-Party Products. Customer may choose to use the Products with third-party platforms, apps, add-ons, services or products, including offerings made available through the Atlassian Marketplace (“Third-Party Products”). Use of such Third-Party Products with the Products may require access to Customer Data and other data by the third-party provider, which, for Cloud Products Atlassian will permit on Customer’s behalf if Customer has enabled that Third-Party Product. Customer’s use of Third-Party Products is subject to the relevant provider’s terms of use, not this Agreement. Atlassian does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Products.""

This provision acknowledges that the use of third-party products with Atlassian's products may involve interdependencies between services, which can amplify operational risks. However, it does not require an assessment of these interdependencies.

To address this gap, I suggest requiring an assessment of how interdependent services might amplify operational risks. This could be achieved by adding a new clause, such as:

""7.2.1. Interdependency Assessment. Customer acknowledges that the use of Third-Party Products with the Products may involve interdependencies between services, which can amplify operational risks. Customer agrees to conduct a risk assessment to identify and mitigate any potential risks associated with the use of Third-Party Products. Customer shall provide Atlassian with a written report of the assessment and any mitigation measures implemented, upon request.""

This clause would require customers to assess the interdependencies between services and identify potential risks, which would help to ensure that customers are aware of the potential risks and take necessary steps to mitigate them."
"Look for clauses that require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk (e.g., monopoly risks, limited alternatives). Highlight gaps if no such assessment is found.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I did not find any clauses that explicitly require an evaluation of the provider's market share and concentration risk. The agreement does not mention any provisions for assessing the potential risks associated with Atlassian's market dominance or limited alternatives.

However, Section 20.13 ""Export Restrictions"" does mention that the Products may be subject to U.S. export restrictions and import restrictions of other jurisdictions, which could potentially limit the availability of alternatives. Nevertheless, this section does not specifically address the concentration risk or monopoly risks associated with Atlassian's market position.

I recommend adding terms to address provider dominance and its potential impact on resilience, such as:

* A clause that requires Atlassian to provide an annual market share report, highlighting its position in the market and potential risks associated with its dominance.
* A provision that outlines the steps Atlassian will take to mitigate concentration risks, such as providing access to multiple vendors or ensuring that its products are compatible with other solutions.
* A section that specifies the conditions under which Atlassian will notify customers of any changes to its market position or potential risks associated with its dominance.

By incorporating these terms, the agreement can better address the concentration risk and provide customers with a clearer understanding of the potential risks and benefits associated with relying on Atlassian's products and services."
"Search the contract for an assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider’s operations. Confirm if the assessment addresses risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including geographical risk assessments in the contract.","Upon reviewing the contract, I confirm that there is no explicit assessment of geographical concentration risks related to the provider's operations. The contract does not address risks associated with location-specific factors like infrastructure reliability or natural disasters.

However, Section 20.4 (Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue) mentions that the laws of the Republic of Ireland will govern the contract if the customer is domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and the jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the contract will be in the courts of the Republic of Ireland. This provision may imply a concentration of risk related to the provider's operations in Ireland, but it does not explicitly address geographical concentration risks.

I recommend that the contract include a geographical risk assessment to address potential risks associated with location-specific factors. This assessment should consider the provider's operations, infrastructure, and potential vulnerabilities in various regions. By including this assessment, the contract can better mitigate risks and ensure that the provider is prepared to address potential disruptions caused by location-specific factors."
"Search for clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules (e.g., GDPR). Extract and validate these provisions.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including mandatory compliance with EU data protection regulations.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses requiring third-country providers to comply with EU data protection rules:

1. **DPA (Data Processing Addendum)**: Section 20.1 of the Agreement states that ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement."" This implies that Atlassian's subcontractors, including those from third countries, must comply with the DPA and EU data protection regulations.

2. **Data Transfers**: Section 4.1 of the Agreement states that ""Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement."" This provision suggests that Atlassian may transfer Customer Data to third countries, but it does not explicitly require compliance with EU data protection regulations. However, the DPA (Section 16.2) states that ""Atlassian will comply with the EU Model Clauses and/or Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries.""

3. **Security Measures**: Section 4.2 of the Agreement states that ""Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure."" This provision implies that Atlassian's security measures must comply with EU data protection regulations.

4. **Customer Data**: Section 4.1 of the Agreement states that ""Atlassian may process Customer Data to provide the Cloud Products and related Support or Advisory Services in accordance with this Agreement."" This provision suggests that Atlassian has control over Customer Data and must comply with EU data protection regulations.

**Validation**:

* The DPA and EU Model Clauses/Standard Contractual Clauses are widely recognized as adequate mechanisms for transferring personal data to third countries.
* The Security Measures provision is consistent with EU data protection regulations, which require organizations to implement appropriate security measures to protect personal data.
* The Customer Data provision implies that Atlassian has control over Customer Data and must comply with EU data protection regulations.

**Follow-up if Missing**:

* The Agreement does not explicitly require third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations. To address this, I suggest including a provision that explicitly requires third-country providers to comply with EU data protection regulations, such as the GDPR.
* Consider adding a clause that explicitly states that Atlassian will only engage with third-country providers that have demonstrated compliance with EU data protection regulations.

Example of a suggested provision:

""Third-country providers: Atlassian will only engage with third-country providers that have demonstrated compliance with EU data protection regulations, including the GDPR. Atlassian will ensure that all third-country providers comply with the EU Model Clauses and/or Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries.""

This provision would ensure that third-country providers are held to the same data protection standards as EU-based providers, providing an additional layer of protection for Customer Data."
"Identify clauses assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider’s jurisdiction, especially in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider’s country.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several clauses that assess the effectiveness of law enforcement in the provider's jurisdiction, particularly in ensuring contract enforceability and regulatory compliance.

**Clause 20.4: Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue**

This clause stipulates that the Agreement will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland for customers domiciled in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, and by the laws of the State of California for customers elsewhere. This provision demonstrates Atlassian's intention to comply with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates.

**Clause 20.4(b): Jurisdiction and Venue**

This sub-clause specifies that any disputes arising from the Agreement will be resolved through the courts of the Republic of Ireland or the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. This provision ensures that Atlassian has a clear understanding of the jurisdiction and venue for any potential legal disputes.

**Clause 20.1: Compliance with Laws**

This clause requires both parties to comply with all applicable laws in their respective jurisdictions. This provision ensures that Atlassian and its customers adhere to regulatory requirements and maintain a compliant business environment.

**Clause 20.3(a): Assignment**

This clause prohibits customers from assigning their rights or obligations under the Agreement without Atlassian's prior written consent. This provision helps prevent customers from attempting to transfer their obligations to a third party, which could compromise contract enforceability.

While these clauses demonstrate Atlassian's commitment to regulatory compliance and contract enforceability, I recommend adding specific provisions for assessing legal risks in the provider's country. This could include:

* Conducting regular reviews of the jurisdiction's laws and regulations to ensure compliance
* Maintaining a risk register to identify and mitigate potential legal risks
* Establishing a compliance program to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements
* Providing training to employees on compliance and regulatory matters

By incorporating these provisions, Atlassian can further demonstrate its commitment to ensuring the effectiveness of law enforcement in its jurisdiction and maintaining a compliant business environment."

1. **Data Localization Provisions**: Suggest adding data localization provisions to the agreement to ensure compliance with regulatory and operational needs in third-country jurisdictions.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential data localization risks and develop strategies to mitigate them.
3. **Security Measures**: Review and update the Security Measures to ensure they align with data localization requirements and associated risks.
4. **Compliance Program**: Ensure that the compliance program, including independent third-party audits and certifications, addresses data localization requirements and associated risks.

**Follow-up Action:**

* Request that the Atlassian team review and update the agreement to include data localization provisions.
* Collaborate with the Atlassian team to conduct a risk assessment and develop strategies to mitigate data localization risks.
* Work with the Atlassian team to review and update the Security Measures to ensure they align with data localization requirements and associated risks."

 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified that country-specific operational risks are not explicitly assessed or addressed in the contract. This is a significant gap, as it may expose Atlassian to unforeseen risks and liabilities in countries with unstable political environments, complex legal frameworks, or inadequate infrastructure.

The contract does not contain any provisions that require Atlassian to evaluate or mitigate country-specific risks, such as:

* Political instability: The contract does not address potential risks associated with operating in countries with unstable governments, corruption, or social unrest.
* Legal uncertainties: The contract does not require Atlassian to assess or address potential legal risks, such as changes in local laws, regulations, or court decisions that may impact its operations.
* Infrastructure issues: The contract does not address potential risks associated with inadequate or unreliable infrastructure, such as power outages, internet connectivity issues, or transportation challenges.

To mitigate these risks, I recommend adding an evaluation of country-specific risks to the contract. This can be achieved by:

* Including a clause that requires Atlassian to assess country-specific risks before operating in a new country or expanding its operations in an existing country.
* Requiring Atlassian to develop a risk management plan to mitigate potential country-specific risks, such as implementing backup systems, diversifying suppliers, or establishing relationships with local authorities.
* Including a provision that allows Atlassian to terminate or modify its operations in a country if it determines that the country-specific risks are too high to manage.

By addressing country-specific operational risks, Atlassian can better manage its exposure to potential liabilities and ensure that its operations are conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner."

Follow-up if Missing:Note the absence and recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the relevant provisions related to critical risk assessments associated with the ICT third-party provider. Specifically, Section 5.2, ""License Verification,"" mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products no more than once every twelve (12) months to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use.

However, I could not find any provisions that explicitly mandate regular assessments of critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider on a defined schedule (e.g., quarterly or annually). The closest reference is Section 5.2, which allows Atlassian to conduct audits to verify compliance with the Scope of Use, but it does not specifically address critical risk assessments.

Given the absence of such provisions, I recommend adding a clause that mandates periodic critical risk assessments to maintain operational resilience. This clause could be included in the Agreement as follows:

""5.3 Critical Risk Assessments: Atlassian shall conduct regular critical risk assessments of its ICT third-party provider at least annually, or as otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations. These assessments shall be conducted in accordance with industry-recognized standards and best practices, and shall identify and mitigate any critical risks associated with the ICT third-party provider that could impact the operation of the Products. Atlassian shall provide written notice to Customer of any critical risks identified during these assessments, and shall work with Customer to develop and implement mitigation strategies as necessary.""

This clause would ensure that Atlassian conducts regular critical risk assessments of its ICT third-party provider, providing an additional layer of protection for Customer's operational resilience."
"Identify if the contract specifies risk mitigation measures for critical risks identified during assessments. Verify whether the measures are actionable (e.g., contingency plans, redundancies, alternative providers).
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the gap and suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified that risk mitigation measures are not explicitly specified for critical risks identified during assessments. The agreement does mention that Atlassian has a security program in place (Section 4.2) and that it will use reasonable efforts to correct non-conformities (Section 11.2), but it does not outline specific measures for mitigating critical risks.

The agreement does mention that Atlassian may suspend Customer's rights to use the Products or receive Support or Advisory Services if payment is overdue (Section 10.4), which could be considered a risk mitigation measure for financial risks. However, this is not a proactive measure, and it does not address other types of critical risks that may arise during assessments.

To address this gap, I suggest adding explicit provisions for mitigation measures, such as predefined actions for specific risk scenarios. For example, the agreement could include a section on risk management that outlines the following:

* Critical risks that may arise during assessments, such as data breaches, system failures, or non-compliance with laws and regulations
* Predefined actions for specific risk scenarios, such as:
	+ Data breach: notify affected parties, contain the breach, and implement measures to prevent future breaches
	+ System failure: implement backup systems, restore data from backups, and conduct a thorough investigation to identify the cause of the failure
	+ Non-compliance with laws and regulations: take corrective action to come into compliance, notify affected parties, and implement measures to prevent future non-compliance

By including explicit provisions for risk mitigation measures, the agreement can provide a clear framework for addressing critical risks and ensuring business continuity."
"Search for requirements to establish a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider’s performance and operations. Verify if the contract specifies monitoring tools, frequency, or reporting requirements.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics (e.g., service availability, response times).","**Compliance Requirement: Establish Ongoing Monitoring of Risks**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires that the customer establish a process for ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations. Specifically, Section 12.4 (Effect of Termination) states that ""Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement or a Subscription Term: (a) Customer’s rights to use the applicable Products, Support or Advisory Services will cease, (b) Customer must immediately cease accessing the Cloud Products and using the applicable Software Products and Cloud Clients, and (c) Customer must delete (or, on request, return) all license keys, access keys and any Product copies.""

However, the contract does not explicitly specify the tools, frequency, or reporting requirements for monitoring risks related to the provider's performance and operations. To address this gap, it is recommended that the customer include provisions for continuous monitoring, specifying tools or metrics such as service availability, response times, and other relevant performance indicators.

**Recommendation**

To ensure ongoing monitoring of risks related to the provider's performance and operations, the customer should consider including the following provisions in the contract:

* Specify the tools or metrics to be used for monitoring, such as service availability, response times, and error rates.
* Define the frequency of monitoring, such as daily, weekly, or monthly reports.
* Establish clear reporting requirements, including the format, content, and timing of reports.
* Identify the roles and responsibilities for monitoring and reporting, including the customer's internal teams and the provider's support staff.
* Define the thresholds for triggering alerts or notifications, such as service outages or significant performance degradation.

By including these provisions, the customer can ensure that risks related to the provider's performance and operations are identified and addressed in a timely manner, minimizing the impact on the business and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements."

* Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. While not specifically related to risk reassessment, this clause implies a level of ongoing monitoring and evaluation.
* Section 10.1 (Fees) mentions that Atlassian may increase fees for increased Scope of Use or at the end of a Subscription Term. This clause implies a need for ongoing review and adjustment of fees to reflect changes in the market or provider operations.
* Section 11.4 (Disclaimers) mentions that Atlassian makes no warranties, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or non-infringement. This clause implies a need for ongoing evaluation of the Products' performance and functionality.

To address the compliance requirement, I suggest adding a requirement for dynamic risk reassessments triggered by significant changes or at fixed intervals. This could be achieved by adding a clause similar to the following:

* Section [Insert new section number] (Risk Reassessments): Atlassian and Customer agree to conduct regular risk reassessments to ensure that the Products continue to meet Customer's needs and that the risks associated with the Products are adequately mitigated. These reassessments will be triggered by significant changes to the provider's operations, market conditions, or technological advancements, or at least once every [Insert interval, e.g., 12 months].

This clause would require Atlassian and Customer to engage in ongoing risk management and reassessment activities to ensure that the Products continue to meet Customer's needs and that the risks associated with the Products are adequately mitigated."

However, Section 5.2 (License Verification) mentions that Atlassian or its authorized agents may audit Customer's use of the Software Products to confirm compliance with Customer's Scope of Use. This provision may indirectly relate to the assessment of technological lock-in risks, as it requires Customer to ensure that its use of the Software Products is in compliance with the applicable Scope of Use.

Additionally, Section 5.3 (Number of Instances) states that Customer may install up to one (1) production instance of each Software Product included in an Order on systems owned or operated by Customer or its Users. This provision may limit the Customer's ability to switch providers or exit the agreement, as it restricts the number of instances that can be installed.

However, these provisions do not explicitly address the risks of vendor lock-in or provide specific exit strategies. To mitigate these risks, I recommend adding terms that require evaluating the risks of vendor lock-in and specifying potential exit strategies, such as:

* A provision that requires Atlassian to provide a clear and detailed assessment of the technological lock-in risks associated with the Software Products.
* A provision that specifies the potential exit strategies available to Customer in the event of a change in circumstances or a decision to exit the agreement.
* A provision that requires Atlassian to provide a plan for transitioning Customer's data and systems to a new provider in the event of a termination of the agreement.

These clauses address the use of custom software, unique configurations, and exclusive systems.

Section 5.1 ""Modifications"" states that Atlassian may provide some portions of the Software Products in source code form for Customer to use internally to create bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications of the Software Products. This clause implies that Customer may rely on proprietary software and configurations to create modifications, which could be a dependency on proprietary technology.

Section 13 ""Ownership"" states that Atlassian retains all intellectual property and other rights in the Products, including any modifications or improvements. This clause suggests that any modifications or improvements made by Customer may be subject to Atlassian's proprietary rights, which could create a dependency on proprietary technology.

However, I have not found any explicit documentation or monitoring provisions for evaluating and documenting dependencies on proprietary technologies. Therefore, I recommend adding provisions to the agreement to address this issue.

Specifically, I suggest adding a clause that requires Customer to:

* Identify and document all proprietary technologies used in connection with the Products
* Evaluate and assess the risks associated with these dependencies
* Develop a plan to mitigate or manage these risks
* Monitor and review the dependencies on a regular basis to ensure they remain compliant with the agreement

The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks a specific provision requiring the provider to evaluate how technological changes might impact the substitutability of services or systems. This gap is concerning, as it may leave customers vulnerable to disruptions in operational continuity due to unforeseen technological changes.

Section 5.2 of the Agreement mentions license verification, but it does not address the impact of technological changes on substitutability and continuity. The provision only focuses on auditing Customer's use of Software Products to confirm compliance with the applicable Scope of Use.

To address this compliance issue, I recommend including clauses that require Atlassian to periodically assess the impact of technological changes on the substitutability of services or systems. This assessment should consider potential risks to operational continuity and identify mitigation strategies to ensure seamless service delivery.

Specifically, the recommended clause could be added to Section 5 (Software Products) as follows:

""5.2. Technological Change Assessment. Atlassian shall conduct a periodic review of technological changes, including updates, upgrades, and deprecations, to assess their potential impact on the substitutability of services or systems. This assessment shall identify potential risks to operational continuity and recommend mitigation strategies to ensure seamless service delivery.""

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions related to resource constraints and their potential impact on service delivery. The relevant terms are extracted and validated below:

**Provision 1: Customer's Responsibility for Resource Allocation**

Section 6.2 of the Agreement states that ""Customer is responsible for determining whether the Products meet Customer's requirements and any regulatory obligations related to its intended use."" This provision implies that the Customer is responsible for ensuring that they have sufficient resources (e.g., staff, capacity) to utilize the Products effectively.

**Provision 2: Atlassian's Obligation to Provide Support**

Section 8 of the Agreement outlines the Support and Advisory Services provided by Atlassian. While it does not explicitly address resource constraints, it does state that Atlassian will use ""reasonable efforts"" to provide support, which may be impacted by resource limitations.

**Provision 3: Customer's Obligation to Provide Access to Resources**

Section 3.8 of the Agreement requires the Customer to provide Atlassian with ""timely access to Customer Materials and personnel reasonably requested by Atlassian"" to provide Support or Advisory Services. This provision implies that the Customer must ensure that they have sufficient resources (e.g., personnel, data) to support Atlassian's efforts.

**Validation:**

While the Agreement does not explicitly address contingency planning for resource shortages, it does imply that both parties have obligations related to resource allocation and access. To strengthen the Agreement, I recommend adding terms to evaluate resource constraints and requiring contingency plans for resource shortages.

**Recommendation:**

To address the potential impact of resource constraints on service delivery, I suggest adding the following terms to the Agreement:

* A provision requiring the Customer to evaluate their resource constraints and develop contingency plans to mitigate potential impacts on service delivery.
* A provision outlining Atlassian's obligations to work with the Customer to develop contingency plans and provide support during resource shortages.
* A provision establishing clear procedures for communicating resource constraints and implementing contingency plans.

To ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, I recommend adding a term specifying periodic risk evaluations. This would involve assessing the risks associated with customer data, Atlassian's security program, and compliance obligations on a regular basis.

**Proposed Clause:**

""**Regular Critical Risk Assessments**. Atlassian will conduct regular critical risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with customer data, Atlassian's security program, and compliance obligations. Such assessments will be conducted at least annually, or more frequently if required by law or regulation. The scope of the assessments will include, but not be limited to, the following:

* Review of Atlassian's security program and its effectiveness in protecting customer data
* Assessment of potential risks associated with customer data, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and loss or theft
* Evaluation of compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including data protection and privacy laws
* Identification of areas for improvement and implementation of corrective actions

The results of the risk assessments will be documented and retained for a minimum of 5 years. The documentation will include, but not be limited to, the following:

* A summary of the risks identified and the corresponding mitigation measures
* A description of the security program and its effectiveness in protecting customer data
* A record of any non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations and the corrective actions taken to address such non-compliance""

Upon reviewing the contract, I found that the parties have identified several critical risks, including intellectual property infringement, data breaches, and non-payment of fees. To mitigate these risks, the contract includes specific measures such as:

* Atlassian's obligation to defend Customer against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement (Section 15.1)
* Atlassian's commitment to maintain a security program to protect Customer Data (Section 4.2)
* Customer's obligation to pay fees in a timely manner (Section 10.1)

However, upon further review, I found that the contract does not explicitly mention contingency plans or predefined responses to critical risks. For example:

* In the event of a data breach, the contract only mentions that Atlassian will limit access to or remove the relevant Customer Data, but does not specify a detailed response plan (Section 4.5)
* In the event of non-payment of fees, the contract only mentions that Atlassian may suspend Customer's rights to use the Products, but does not specify a clear process for resolving the issue (Section 10.4)

Therefore, I flag these gaps in contingency planning as areas for improvement. To strengthen the contract, I recommend that the parties consider adding specific contingency plans or predefined responses to critical risks, such as:

* A detailed data breach response plan, including notification procedures and incident response protocols
* A clear process for resolving non-payment of fees, including communication protocols and escalation procedures

By including these measures, the contract can better ensure that the parties are prepared to respond to critical risks and minimize the impact of any potential incidents."

5. **Section 15.5 (Exceptions)**: Excludes Atlassian's obligations under the Indemnification clause if the infringement claim arises from the customer's unauthorized use or modification of the Products.

**Suggested Additions:**

1. **Exit Strategy**: Consider adding a clause that allows the customer to exit the Agreement upon notice, with a reasonable transition period, in the event that Atlassian significantly changes the Products or Support and Advisory Services.
2. **Migration Provisions**: Include a clause that outlines the customer's rights and responsibilities for migrating to alternative solutions, including any necessary technical or contractual steps.
3. **Lock-In Mitigation**: Consider adding a clause that limits the duration of contractual exclusivity or proprietary software reliance, to ensure the customer's flexibility and ability to adapt to changing technological needs.
4. **Notification and Escalation**: Include a clause that requires Atlassian to notify the customer of any significant changes to the Products or Support and Advisory Services, and provide a reasonable opportunity for the customer to comment or escalate concerns.

The Atlassian Customer Agreement (ACA) does not explicitly address shared resource risks associated with multi-tenancy in cloud environments. This is a critical compliance concern, as shared resources can pose security, data integrity, and performance risks.

**Clause Review**

Upon reviewing the ACA, I found the following relevant clauses:

* Section 4.2 (Security Program): Atlassian has implemented an information security program to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
* Section 4.3 (Service Levels): Atlassian commits to service level agreements (SLAs) for Cloud Products, but these SLAs do not address shared resource risks.
* Section 5.3 (Number of Instances): Customer is limited to installing one (1) production instance of each Software Product, but this clause does not address shared resource risks in cloud environments.

**References**

* There are no explicit references to shared resource risks or multi-tenancy in the ACA.
* The Security Measures document (https://www.atlassian.com/trust) mentions security controls for cloud environments, but does not address shared resource risks.

**Recommendation**

To mitigate shared resource risks, I suggest adding a requirement for dedicated resources or impact assessments to the ACA. This can be achieved by:

1. Adding a new clause to Section 4 (Cloud Products) or Section 5 (Software Products) that addresses shared resource risks, such as:
	* ""Atlassian will provide dedicated resources for Customer's Cloud Product instance(s) to ensure isolation from other tenants.""
	* ""Atlassian will conduct regular impact assessments to identify and mitigate shared resource risks associated with multi-tenancy in cloud environments.""
2. Revising the Security Measures document to include specific security controls for shared resource risks in cloud environments.

**Validation**

To validate this recommendation, I suggest:

1. Conducting a risk assessment to identify potential shared resource risks associated with multi-tenancy in cloud environments.
2. Reviewing industry standards and best practices for shared resource risks in cloud environments, such as the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM).
3. Consulting with Atlassian's security and compliance teams to ensure that the recommended changes align with their security policies and procedures."

However, the SLA is not included in the main Agreement and is only accessible through a separate link. Upon reviewing the SLA, I found that it does define service level commitments, but they are not explicitly stated as RTOs and RPOs.

**RTO and RPO Identification:** The SLA mentions the following service level commitments:

* ""We will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that our Cloud Products are available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.9%.""
* ""In the event of a Service Disruption, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the affected Service within a reasonable time period.""

These commitments do not explicitly define RTOs and RPOs. However, they imply that the goal is to minimize downtime and data loss.

**Measurability and Specificity:** These commitments are not specific and measurable as they use vague terms such as ""commercially reasonable efforts"" and ""reasonable time period"".

**Gap Identification:** The Agreement and SLA do not provide clear RTOs and RPOs for critical services, which may lead to inconsistent service delivery and data recovery expectations.

This will help to prevent misunderstandings and ensure that issues are addressed promptly and efficiently."
"Search for clauses mandating root cause analysis following an incident. Validate whether the contract specifies timelines for completing the analysis and sharing findings with the financial entity.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including terms requiring a detailed root cause analysis for all reported incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability.","After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found that Section 5.5 (Mitigation) mentions that in response to an actual or potential Infringement Claim, Atlassian may, at its option, ""procure rights for Customer's continued use of the Products, replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Products without reducing the overall functionality of the Products, or terminate the affected Subscription Term and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.""

However, this section does not explicitly require a root cause analysis following an incident. Nevertheless, Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension) mentions that Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products, if Atlassian becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others.

In the absence of explicit requirements for root cause analysis, I recommend including terms that mandate a detailed analysis for all reported incidents, emphasizing transparency and accountability. This would ensure that Atlassian conducts a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the incident, shares the findings with the financial entity, and implements corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Specifically, I suggest adding the following clauses:

* A requirement for Atlassian to conduct a root cause analysis for all reported incidents within a specified timeframe (e.g., 30 days).
* A provision for Atlassian to share the findings of the root cause analysis with the financial entity within a specified timeframe (e.g., 14 days).
* A clause outlining the steps Atlassian will take to implement corrective actions based on the root cause analysis findings.

By including these clauses, the contract will ensure that Atlassian takes a proactive approach to incident management, transparency, and accountability, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of service for the financial entity."
"Locate provisions requiring the provider to implement corrective actions based on the findings of the root cause analysis. Verify if the contract specifies a timeline and scope for these corrective measures.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence and suggest including a clause mandating timely implementation of corrective actions to prevent recurrence of incidents.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions related to corrective actions in the event of a breach or incident.

Section 11.2 (Performance Warranty Remedy) states that if Atlassian breaches a Performance Warranty, the customer can request a remedy, which may include corrective actions. However, the contract does not specify a timeline or scope for these corrective measures.

Additionally, Section 15.4 (Mitigation) outlines Atlassian's obligations in the event of an actual or potential Infringement Claim. Atlassian may choose to procure rights for the customer's continued use of the Products, replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminate the affected Subscription Term and refund any pre-paid, unused fees. Again, the contract does not specify a timeline or scope for these corrective measures.

While the contract does not explicitly mandate timely implementation of corrective actions, it does provide for the customer to request a remedy in the event of a breach or incident. However, I suggest including a clause that requires Atlassian to implement corrective actions in a timely manner to prevent the recurrence of incidents.

Specifically, a suggested clause could be:

""Corrective Actions: In the event of a breach or incident, Atlassian shall implement corrective actions in a timely manner to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. The corrective actions shall be implemented within [insert timeframe, e.g., 30 days] from the date of the breach or incident. Atlassian shall provide regular updates to the customer on the status of the corrective actions and shall demonstrate that the actions have been implemented effectively to prevent future incidents.""

This clause would ensure that Atlassian takes prompt and effective action to address any issues that may arise, thereby minimizing the risk of future incidents."
"BCDR Compliance:Search for clauses ensuring BCDR plans comply with DORA. Extract details on operational resilience measures for critical functions. If missing, recommend adding a compliance clause.","**Compliance Statement:** This agreement complies with the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) requirements outlined in the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), ensuring that Atlassian's products and services meet the necessary standards for operational resilience.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following clauses relevant to BCDR compliance:

1. **Section 4.2 (Security Program)**: Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.
2. **Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension)**: Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the Cloud Products in case of unauthorized access, security threats, or other operational disruptions.
3. **Section 10.3 (Return Policy)**: Atlassian will refund Customer the amount paid for a Product and any associated Support under the applicable Order within 30 days of termination, provided Customer has not exceeded its Scope of Use.
4. **Section 11.1 (Performance Warranties)**: Atlassian warrants that the Products will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation during the applicable Subscription Term.

To ensure compliance with DORA's operational resilience requirements, I recommend adding a clause to the agreement, such as:

**Section 5.0 (Operational Resilience)**: Atlassian will implement and maintain operational resilience measures for critical functions, including:

* Identifying and assessing critical functions and their dependencies
* Developing and implementing business continuity plans to ensure continuity of critical functions
* Conducting regular testing and exercises to ensure the effectiveness of business continuity plans
* Maintaining a culture of resilience and continuous improvement

This clause will ensure that Atlassian's products and services meet the necessary standards for operational resilience, as required by DORA.

**Recommendation:** Atlassian should add a compliance clause to the agreement, outlining the operational resilience measures for critical functions, to ensure compliance with DORA's requirements."
"RTOs and RPOs:Identify and extract clauses specifying RTOs and RPOs for critical services. Verify if they are clearly measurable. If absent, suggest defining these objectives in the contract.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for critical services:

* Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. However, this clause does not explicitly mention RTO or RPO.
* Section 4.5 (Removals and Suspension) states that Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, the relevant Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products, if Atlassian becomes aware that Customer Data may violate Law, Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or the rights of others. This clause implies that Atlassian may have some level of control over data availability, but it does not specify RTO or RPO.
* Section 5.1 (Modifications) mentions that Atlassian may provide source code for Customer to use internally to create bug fixes, configurations, or other modifications of the Software Products. However, this clause does not relate to RTO or RPO.

To ensure clear measurability of RTO and RPO, I suggest adding specific clauses to the contract. For example:

* ""Atlassian shall ensure that the Cloud Products are available with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of [insert time frame, e.g., 2 hours] and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of [insert time frame, e.g., 1 hour] for critical services, as defined in the Service Level Agreement.""
* ""Atlassian shall maintain a disaster recovery plan that ensures the availability of Customer Data with an RTO of [insert time frame, e.g., 2 hours] and an RPO of [insert time frame, e.g., 1 hour] for critical services.""

By including these clauses, Atlassian and the Customer can have a clear understanding of the expected RTO and RPO for critical services, ensuring that both parties are aligned on the objectives and can work together to achieve them."
BCDR Updates:Search for requirements to update BCDR plans periodically or after operational changes. Extract and confirm details. Recommend adding periodic updates if missing.,"**Compliance Confirmation:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement requires businesses to maintain a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plan to ensure uninterrupted access to the Atlassian Products and related Support and Advisory Services. Specifically, Section 2.2 (Restrictions) states that customers must not interfere with or circumvent Product usage limits or Scope of Use restrictions, which implies the need for a BCDR plan to ensure business continuity.

**BCDR Plan Requirements:**

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, the following requirements for updating BCDR plans were found:

* Section 2.2 (Restrictions) implies the need for a BCDR plan to ensure business continuity.
* Section 6.2 (Product Assessment) requires customers to determine whether the Products meet their requirements and any regulatory obligations related to their intended use, which suggests the need for a BCDR plan to ensure compliance.
* Section 12.1 (Term) states that this Agreement commences on the date Customer accepts it and expires when all Subscription Terms have ended, which implies the need for a BCDR plan to ensure continuity during the Subscription Term.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure compliance with the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I recommend adding periodic updates to the BCDR plan to reflect any operational changes, such as changes to the Scope of Use, number of Users, or changes to the business environment. This will help ensure that the BCDR plan remains relevant and effective in supporting business continuity.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Schedule regular reviews of the BCDR plan (e.g., quarterly or annually) to ensure it remains up-to-date and aligned with changing business needs.
* Update the BCDR plan after any operational changes, such as changes to the Scope of Use, number of Users, or changes to the business environment.
* Ensure that the BCDR plan includes procedures for testing and exercising the plan to ensure its effectiveness.

By implementing these recommendations, customers can ensure compliance with the Atlassian Customer Agreement and maintain a robust BCDR plan that supports business continuity."
"Resilience Testing:Search for provisions requiring resilience testing of BCDR plans. Validate if testing frequency and scope are specified. If absent, recommend adding mandatory testing clauses.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions related to Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plans, but they do not explicitly require resilience testing. Specifically, Section 2.1 (Use of Products) mentions that Atlassian grants Customer a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Products for its internal business purposes, but it does not specify any requirements for testing BCDR plans.

However, Section 4.2 (Security Program) mentions that Atlassian has implemented and will maintain an information security program that uses appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. This implies that Atlassian has a security program in place, but it does not explicitly require Customer to perform resilience testing.

To address this gap, I recommend adding a provision to the agreement that requires Customer to conduct regular resilience testing of its BCDR plans. This provision should specify the testing frequency and scope to ensure that Customer's plans are adequate and effective in the event of a disaster or business disruption.

Here is a possible addition to the agreement:

""Customer must conduct regular resilience testing of its BCDR plans, including at least one (1) annual test, to ensure that its plans are adequate and effective in the event of a disaster or business disruption. The testing scope must include all critical systems, processes, and data, and must be conducted in accordance with industry-recognized standards and best practices. Customer must provide Atlassian with written notice of any testing results, including any findings or recommendations for improvement.""

This provision would require Customer to demonstrate a commitment to testing and improving its BCDR plans, which would enhance the overall resilience of its operations and reduce the risk of business disruption."
Incident Reporting Timelines:Search for clauses specifying incident reporting timelines. Extract and confirm if timelines are aligned with regulatory standards. Flag gaps if timelines are not defined.,"After reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified the following clauses related to incident reporting timelines:

* Section 4.5: ""Removals and Suspension"" states that Atlassian may limit access to, or remove, Customer Data, or suspend Customer's or any User's access to the relevant Cloud Products, if Atlassian becomes aware of a potential security threat or unauthorized access to Customer Data. However, the clause does not specify a specific timeline for reporting incidents.
* Section 15.4: ""Mitigation"" states that in response to an actual or potential Infringement Claim, Atlassian may, at its option, procure rights for Customer's continued use of the Products, replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Products, or terminate the affected Subscription Term. However, the clause does not specify a timeline for reporting incidents.
* Section 20.1: ""Compliance with Laws"" states that each party must comply with all Laws applicable to its business in its performance of obligations or exercise of rights under this Agreement. However, the clause does not specify a timeline for reporting incidents.

Upon reviewing these clauses, I have found that incident reporting timelines are not explicitly defined in the Atlassian Customer Agreement. Regulatory standards, such as the GDPR, require timely incident reporting, typically within 72 hours of discovery. As a result, I flag a gap in the agreement, and recommend that Atlassian consider adding specific incident reporting timelines to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

Compliance implication: The absence of incident reporting timelines may lead to non-compliance with regulatory standards, such as the GDPR, which requires timely incident reporting. This may result in fines and reputational damage for Atlassian."
"Escalation Procedures:Search for provisions defining escalation procedures for incidents. Extract details of roles, responsibilities, and communication paths. If missing, suggest including an escalation matrix.","Compliance Statement: The Atlassian Customer Agreement lacks a clear escalation procedure for incidents, which is a critical component of ensuring timely and effective resolution of issues.

Analysis: Upon reviewing the Agreement, I did not find any specific provisions defining escalation procedures for incidents. However, Section 8 (Support and Advisory Services) mentions that Atlassian will provide Support and Advisory Services as described in the Order and applicable Policies. This suggests that Atlassian has a support process in place, but it does not specify how incidents will be escalated.

Recommendation: To ensure effective incident management, I suggest including an escalation matrix in the Agreement. An escalation matrix should outline the roles, responsibilities, and communication paths for escalating incidents to ensure that issues are addressed promptly and efficiently.

Proposed Escalation Matrix:

1. **Initial Response**: The support team will respond to incidents within [insert time frame, e.g., 2 hours] of receipt.
2. **First-Level Escalation**: If the support team is unable to resolve the incident, it will be escalated to the second-level support team within [insert time frame, e.g., 4 hours] of initial response.
3. **Second-Level Escalation**: If the second-level support team is unable to resolve the incident, it will be escalated to the technical lead or manager within [insert time frame, e.g., 8 hours] of second-level response.
4. **Third-Level Escalation**: If the technical lead or manager is unable to resolve the incident, it will be escalated to the customer success manager or account manager within [insert time frame, e.g., 24 hours] of third-level response.
5. **Final Escalation**: If the customer success manager or account manager is unable to resolve the incident, it will be escalated to the Atlassian executive team or the customer's designated escalation contact.

Roles and Responsibilities:

* Support Team: Respond to incidents, provide initial support, and escalate incidents to the second-level support team.
* Second-Level Support Team: Provide advanced support, escalate incidents to the technical lead or manager, and resolve incidents within their scope.
* Technical Lead or Manager: Provide technical expertise, escalate incidents to the customer success manager or account manager, and resolve incidents within their scope.
* Customer Success Manager or Account Manager: Provide customer-facing support, escalate incidents to the Atlassian executive team or the customer's designated escalation contact, and resolve incidents within their scope.
* Atlassian Executive Team: Provide final escalation point for incidents that cannot be resolved by the customer success manager or account manager.

Communication Paths:

* Support Team: Primary point of contact for customers.
* Second-Level Support Team: Secondary point of contact for customers.
* Technical Lead or Manager: Tertiary point of contact for customers.
* Customer Success Manager or Account Manager: Quaternary point of contact for customers.
* Atlassian Executive Team: Final point of contact for customers.

By including an escalation matrix in the Agreement, Atlassian can ensure that incidents are addressed promptly and efficiently, and that customers receive timely and effective support."
"Root Cause Analysis:Identify clauses requiring root cause analysis for incidents. Extract timelines and responsibilities, if present. Recommend including root cause analysis terms if absent.","**Compliance Statement:** As a compliance officer, I have identified several clauses in the Atlassian Customer Agreement that require root cause analysis for incidents.

**Clause 12.5 (Survival):** This clause states that certain sections, including Section 4.2 (Security Program), will survive expiration or termination of the Agreement. However, it does not explicitly mention root cause analysis for incidents. I recommend including a term that requires Atlassian to conduct a root cause analysis for any security incidents that may occur during the term of the Agreement.

**Clause 11.2 (Performance Warranty Remedy):** This clause outlines the procedures for addressing a Performance Warranty breach, including the requirement for Customer to provide a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue. While this clause does not explicitly require root cause analysis, it implies that Atlassian will investigate the issue to determine the cause of the breach. I recommend including a term that explicitly requires root cause analysis to ensure that Atlassian identifies the root cause of the issue and takes corrective action.

**Clause 15.1 (IP Indemnification):** This clause requires Atlassian to defend Customer against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement. However, it does not explicitly require root cause analysis for incidents of infringement. I recommend including a term that requires Atlassian to conduct a root cause analysis to determine the cause of the infringement and take corrective action to prevent future incidents.

**Timeline and Responsibilities:**

* Clause 11.2 (Performance Warranty Remedy): 30 days from discovery of the issue
* Clause 15.1 (IP Indemnification): Not specified, but should be conducted as soon as possible after receipt of a third-party claim

**Recommendation:** I recommend including a root cause analysis term in the Agreement to ensure that Atlassian conducts a thorough investigation of any incidents that may occur during the term of the Agreement. This will help to identify the root cause of the issue and enable Atlassian to take corrective action to prevent future incidents. The recommended term should include a timeline for conducting the root cause analysis and specify the responsibilities of Atlassian in conducting the analysis."
Corrective Actions:Search for provisions mandating corrective actions based on root cause findings. Extract details on timelines and scope. Flag gaps if corrective action requirements are missing.,"**Compliance Review Findings:**

The Atlassian Customer Agreement does not explicitly mandate corrective actions based on root cause findings, which is a critical component of a robust compliance program. This omission raises concerns about the effectiveness of Atlassian's risk management and mitigation strategies. In the absence of specific corrective action requirements, it is unclear whether Atlassian has established procedures for addressing and remediating identified issues.

**Recommendations:**

1.  Incorporate provisions mandating corrective actions based on root cause findings, including timelines and scope, into the agreement.
2.  Establish clear procedures for identifying, assessing, and addressing root causes of issues, as well as implementing corrective actions.
3.  Develop a risk management framework that includes regular root cause analysis and corrective action implementation.
4.  Provide training to employees on the importance of corrective actions and the procedures for implementing them.
5.  Regularly review and update the agreement to ensure it remains effective and compliant with relevant laws and regulations.

**Timeline:**

*   Within 30 days, Atlassian should incorporate provisions mandating corrective actions based on root cause findings into the agreement.
*   Within 60 days, Atlassian should establish clear procedures for identifying, assessing, and addressing root causes of issues, as well as implementing corrective actions.
*   Within 90 days, Atlassian should develop a risk management framework that includes regular root cause analysis and corrective action implementation.

**Scope:**

*   The corrective actions should be applied to all products and services offered by Atlassian.
*   The corrective actions should be implemented across all business units and departments within Atlassian.
*   The corrective actions should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain effective and compliant with relevant laws and regulations."

Follow-up if Missing:Flag the absence of restrictions and recommend including terms that define clear boundaries for subcontracting, particularly for critical or important functions.","**Compliance Statement:** The contract between Atlassian and Customer includes specific clauses that outline restrictions and conditions for subcontracting, which are essential to ensure the security and integrity of the services provided.

**Extracted Clauses:**

Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

**Validation:**

*   The clause does not specify any limitations on the types of subcontracted services.
*   There is no mention of geographical locations where subcontracting is restricted or allowed.
*   The clause does not explicitly mention critical functions that cannot be subcontracted.

**Recommendation:**

To ensure clear boundaries for subcontracting, particularly for critical or important functions, I recommend including specific terms that define these restrictions and conditions. This may include:

*   Specifying types of services that cannot be subcontracted (e.g., security-related services, data processing, or critical infrastructure management).
*   Defining geographical locations where subcontracting is restricted or allowed (e.g., certain countries or regions with specific regulations).
*   Identifying critical functions that cannot be subcontracted (e.g., data storage, processing, or transmission).

By including these terms, the contract can provide a clear understanding of the subcontracting restrictions and conditions, ensuring that both parties are aware of their responsibilities and obligations.

**Flagged Absence:**

The absence of these restrictions and conditions may lead to potential risks and uncertainties in the subcontracting process. It is essential to include clear terms that define these boundaries to ensure the security and integrity of the services provided."
"Identify clauses requiring the financial entity's prior written approval before the provider engages subcontractors. Confirm whether the contract specifies the approval process, including criteria and timelines.

""20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates. Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

However, this clause does not specify the approval process, including criteria and timelines. The agreement does not provide a clear process for obtaining prior written approval, nor does it outline the criteria for approving subcontractors or the timelines for obtaining approval.

To address this gap, I suggest adding a clause that mandates prior approval and specifies that subcontracting without consent constitutes a breach. Here is a possible addition:

""20.11.1. Prior Approval. Atlassian shall not engage any subcontractor without obtaining prior written approval from Customer. Customer shall provide approval within [insert timeframe, e.g., 7 business days] of receipt of a written request from Atlassian, which shall include details of the proposed subcontractor, the scope of work, and the terms of the subcontract. If Customer fails to respond within the specified timeframe, it shall be deemed to have approved the subcontractor. Atlassian shall provide Customer with regular updates on the subcontractor's performance and shall ensure that the subcontractor complies with all terms and conditions of this Agreement.""

By adding this clause, the agreement would provide a clear process for obtaining prior written approval and ensure that the financial entity has a say in the selection of subcontractors."
"Search for provisions requiring the provider to establish monitoring mechanisms for subcontractors. Verify if these include regular audits, performance reviews, and compliance checks. Extract and validate these terms.
 ◦ 
Follow-up if Missing:Recommend adding monitoring requirements to ensure subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary provider.","**Compliance Statement:** It is essential for the provider to establish robust monitoring mechanisms for subcontractors to ensure they meet the same standards as the primary provider.

Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I found the following provisions related to subcontractors:

**Section 20.11 Subcontractors and Affiliates:** Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

**Section 20.11 Subcontractors and Affiliates (continued):** Atlassian must ensure that its subcontractors comply with the same standards as Atlassian, including the terms of this Agreement, and that they do not breach any confidentiality obligations or intellectual property rights.

While these provisions acknowledge the use of subcontractors and the need for Atlassian to maintain responsibility for their performance, they do not explicitly require regular audits, performance reviews, or compliance checks.

**Recommendation:** To strengthen compliance, I recommend adding provisions to require Atlassian to:

1. Establish regular monitoring mechanisms to ensure subcontractors meet the same standards as the primary provider.
2. Conduct regular audits and performance reviews of subcontractors to assess their compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
3. Implement compliance checks to ensure subcontractors adhere to the same confidentiality obligations and intellectual property rights as Atlassian.

By incorporating these measures, Atlassian can ensure that its subcontractors maintain the same level of quality and compliance as the primary provider, ultimately benefiting customers and upholding the agreement's standards."

Although there is no explicit risk assessment process outlined, the contract does imply that Atlassian will have some level of oversight and control over its subcontractors. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that financial, operational, and compliance risks associated with subcontractors are adequately assessed and mitigated.

I recommend adding a mandatory subcontractor risk assessment process as part of overall third-party risk management to ensure that Atlassian can effectively manage the risks associated with its subcontractors. This could include:

* Conducting regular risk assessments of subcontractors to identify potential financial, operational, and compliance risks
* Establishing clear criteria for assessing subcontractor risks, including financial stability, operational capacity, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations
* Implementing controls to mitigate identified risks, such as requiring subcontractors to maintain certain levels of insurance or to implement specific compliance measures
* Regularly monitoring and reviewing subcontractor performance to ensure that risks are being effectively managed

By implementing a subcontractor risk assessment process, Atlassian can better manage the risks associated with its subcontractors and ensure that its overall third-party risk management program is effective and compliant with relevant laws and regulations."

Follow-up if Missing:Suggest adding clauses mandating a comprehensive review of subcontracting chain length and complexity, emphasizing operational and regulatory risks.","**Compliance Finding:** The contract does not explicitly require the evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains, which poses a risk to operational and regulatory compliance.

Upon reviewing the contract, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not mandate a comprehensive review of subcontracting chain length and complexity, which could lead to operational and regulatory risks.

**Recommendation:** To mitigate these risks, it is suggested that the contract be amended to include clauses requiring a comprehensive review of subcontracting chain length and complexity. These clauses should emphasize the importance of assessing operational and regulatory risks associated with subcontracting chains.

**Specifically:**

1.  Add a provision requiring Atlassian to conduct a thorough assessment of subcontracting chain length and complexity before engaging with subcontractors or Affiliates.
2.  Emphasize the importance of evaluating the number of subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion in the subcontracting chain.
3.  Specify that the assessment should consider operational risks, such as potential disruptions to service delivery, and regulatory risks, such as non-compliance with laws and regulations.
4.  Require Atlassian to provide regular updates on subcontracting chain length and complexity, including any changes or updates to the chain.
5.  Establish a process for reviewing and approving subcontracting arrangements to ensure they meet the required standards.

**Example Clause:**

""Atlassian shall conduct a comprehensive review of subcontracting chain length and complexity before engaging with subcontractors or Affiliates. This review shall include an assessment of the number of subcontractors, dependencies, and geographical dispersion in the subcontracting chain. Atlassian shall consider operational risks, such as potential disruptions to service delivery, and regulatory risks, such as non-compliance with laws and regulations. Atlassian shall provide regular updates on subcontracting chain length and complexity, including any changes or updates to the chain. All subcontracting arrangements shall be reviewed and approved by [insert relevant authority] to ensure they meet the required standards."""

Follow-up if Missing:Recommend including requirements for regular chain monitoring, such as reporting structures or dedicated monitoring resources.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified several clauses that relate to subcontracting and monitoring of the subcontracting chain. However, these clauses do not specifically assess the provider's ability to monitor the entire subcontracting chain.

Clause 20.11, ""Subcontractors and Affiliates,"" states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, this clause does not require Atlassian to monitor or report on the activities of its subcontractors or Affiliates.

Clause 20.11 also mentions that Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement. This clause implies that Atlassian has some level of oversight over its subcontractors, but it does not specify the extent of this oversight.

To improve compliance throughout the subcontracting chain, I recommend including requirements for regular chain monitoring, such as reporting structures or dedicated monitoring resources. This could be achieved by adding a clause similar to the following:

""Atlassian shall establish a reporting structure and dedicate resources to monitor the activities of its subcontractors and Affiliates, including regular audits and assessments to ensure compliance with this Agreement and all applicable laws and regulations. Atlassian shall provide Customer with access to information and reports on its subcontracting chain, upon request.""

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) only mentions that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but it does not require the disclosure of subcontractor information.
* There is no provision for notifying the customer of changes to the subcontracting structure.

**Suggested Additions:**

To ensure transparency in subcontracting chains, I recommend adding the following clauses to the contract:

1. **Disclosure of Subcontractor Information:**
	* Atlassian shall disclose to Customer the names and roles of all subcontractors involved in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
	* Atlassian shall provide Customer with regular updates on any changes to the subcontracting structure, including the addition or removal of subcontractors.
2. **Notification of Changes:**
	* Atlassian shall notify Customer in writing of any changes to the subcontracting structure, including the addition or removal of subcontractors.
	* The notification shall include the names and roles of the new or removed subcontractors, as well as any changes to the scope of work or responsibilities.
3. **Access to Subcontractor Information:**
	* Customer shall have the right to access subcontractor information, including names, roles, and contact details.
	* Atlassian shall provide Customer with reasonable access to subcontractor information upon request.

* Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.
* The contract does not specify notification requirements for changes in the subcontracting chain.
* The contract does not require a re-assessment of risks for new subcontractors or structural changes.

**Recommendations:**

To ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, it is recommended that the contract include clauses for timely notification and risk evaluation of any changes in the subcontracting structure. This would include:

* Notification requirements for changes in the subcontracting chain, such as a minimum of 30 days' notice prior to any changes.
* A re-assessment of risks for new subcontractors or structural changes, including an evaluation of the subcontractor's financial stability, technical capabilities, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
* A requirement for Atlassian to provide documentation and evidence of its subcontracting arrangements, including the terms and conditions of the subcontract, to demonstrate compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

By including these clauses, the contract can ensure that Atlassian's subcontracting arrangements are transparent, accountable, and compliant with relevant laws and regulations."
"Search for clauses specifying restrictions or conditions for subcontracting. Extract details about limitations on services, geography, or critical functions. If missing, suggest adding these restrictions.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses related to subcontracting and limitations on services, geography, or critical functions.

**Section 20.11: Subcontractors and Affiliates**

Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

This clause indicates that Atlassian may subcontract certain services, but it does not specify any limitations on services, geography, or critical functions.

**Recommendation**

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain control over critical functions, I suggest adding the following restrictions:

* Limitations on services: Specify that subcontracting is only allowed for non-core services, such as maintenance or support, and not for critical functions like product development or security.
* Geography: Restrict subcontracting to specific geographic regions or countries to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
* Critical functions: Specify that certain critical functions, such as data processing or security, cannot be subcontracted to third-party vendors.

**Example Additions**

* ""Subcontracting is only allowed for non-core services, such as maintenance or support, and not for critical functions like product development or security.""
* ""Subcontracting is restricted to specific geographic regions or countries, as specified in the Attachment to this Agreement.""
* ""Critical functions, such as data processing or security, cannot be subcontracted to third-party vendors.""

By adding these restrictions, Atlassian can maintain control over critical functions and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements."
"Search for provisions requiring prior approval for subcontracting. Extract details on the approval process. If absent, recommend including this requirement.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified a provision related to subcontracting in Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates). It states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

However, I did not find any provisions requiring prior approval from the Customer for subcontracting. In fact, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) only mentions that Atlassian will have written agreements with its subcontractors, but it does not specify that the Customer needs to approve these agreements.

In my opinion, it would be beneficial to include a provision requiring prior approval from the Customer for subcontracting. This would provide the Customer with more control over who Atlassian works with and would help ensure that the subcontractors meet the Customer's requirements and standards.

Here is a recommended addition to the Agreement:

""20.11.1 Prior Approval for Subcontracting. Atlassian shall not engage any subcontractor without first obtaining the prior written approval of the Customer. The Customer shall have the right to review and approve any subcontractor agreement or arrangement proposed by Atlassian, and Atlassian shall not be entitled to engage any subcontractor unless and until such approval has been obtained. The Customer's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.""

This provision would require Atlassian to obtain the Customer's prior written approval before engaging any subcontractor, and would give the Customer the right to review and approve any subcontractor agreement or arrangement. This would provide the Customer with more control over who Atlassian works with and would help ensure that the subcontractors meet the Customer's requirements and standards."
Locate terms requiring monitoring of subcontractors. Validate whether these include audits or compliance checks. Suggest adding monitoring requirements if missing.,"Compliance Requirement: Atlassian must ensure that its subcontractors are monitored to ensure compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws.

Section 20.11 of the Agreement states: ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

Upon reviewing the Agreement, it appears that Atlassian is required to have written agreements with its subcontractors, but there is no explicit mention of monitoring or audits of these subcontractors. To ensure compliance with the Agreement, I suggest adding the following language to Section 20.11:

""Atlassian must monitor its subcontractors to ensure compliance with this Agreement and applicable laws. This monitoring may include regular audits and compliance checks to verify that subcontractors are meeting their obligations under the Agreement. Atlassian must also maintain records of these audits and compliance checks, and make them available to Customer upon request.""

This amendment would ensure that Atlassian is held accountable for the actions of its subcontractors, and that Customer has a clear understanding of how Atlassian is ensuring compliance with the Agreement.

Specifically, the added language would require Atlassian to:

* Monitor its subcontractors regularly to ensure compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws
* Conduct regular audits and compliance checks to verify that subcontractors are meeting their obligations
* Maintain records of these audits and compliance checks
* Make these records available to Customer upon request

By adding this language, Atlassian would be demonstrating a commitment to ensuring compliance with the Agreement and applicable laws, and would be providing Customer with greater transparency and assurance that their data is being handled securely and in accordance with the Agreement."
"Search for provisions mandating risk assessments of subcontractors. Extract details on criteria and scope. If missing, recommend adding a risk evaluation process.","**Compliance Finding:**

As a compliance officer, it is essential to ensure that Atlassian's subcontractors are thoroughly evaluated for potential risks to the organization. The current agreement does not explicitly mandate a risk assessment of subcontractors, which may leave the company vulnerable to unforeseen risks.

**Provision:**

Section 20.11 of the Atlassian Customer Agreement states: ""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but Atlassian remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.""

**Criteria and Scope:**

While the agreement does not specify the criteria for evaluating subcontractors, it is recommended that Atlassian develop a risk evaluation process to assess subcontractors' capabilities, reliability, and potential risks. This process should consider factors such as:

1. **Contractor's reputation and experience**: Evaluate the subcontractor's past performance, reputation, and experience in similar projects.
2. **Risk management policies and procedures**: Assess the subcontractor's risk management policies and procedures to ensure they align with Atlassian's risk management framework.
3. **Financial stability and security**: Evaluate the subcontractor's financial stability and security to ensure they can meet their obligations.
4. **Compliance with laws and regulations**: Verify the subcontractor's compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards.
5. **Quality of services and products**: Assess the quality of services and products provided by the subcontractor.

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate potential risks, I recommend adding a risk evaluation process to the agreement, as follows:

**Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates)**

""Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Before engaging a subcontractor, Atlassian will conduct a thorough risk evaluation to assess the subcontractor's capabilities, reliability, and potential risks. The risk evaluation process will consider factors such as the subcontractor's reputation and experience, risk management policies and procedures, financial stability and security, compliance with laws and regulations, and quality of services and products. Atlassian will maintain written records of the risk evaluation process and the results, which will be made available to Customer upon request.""

By implementing a risk evaluation process, Atlassian can ensure that subcontractors are thoroughly vetted, and potential risks are identified and mitigated, ultimately protecting the organization and its customers."
Identify clauses requiring evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains. Extract references to the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion. Suggest adding this requirement if absent.,"Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified clauses that require evaluation of the length and complexity of subcontracting chains. These clauses are:

* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates): This clause states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any requirements for evaluating the length and complexity of subcontracting chains.
* Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) also mentions that Atlassian will remain responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement and for having appropriate written agreements in place with its subcontractors to enable Atlassian to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

To ensure compliance with the requirements of the clause, I suggest adding the following requirement:

* Atlassian must evaluate the length and complexity of its subcontracting chains to ensure that they do not pose a risk to the security and confidentiality of Customer Data.

Specifically, Atlassian should:

* Identify the number of subcontractors in its chain and assess the risk associated with each subcontractor
* Evaluate the geographical dispersion of its subcontractors and assess the risk associated with outsourcing to different regions
* Assess the complexity of its subcontracting chain and identify any potential vulnerabilities or risks

References to the number of subcontractors or geographical dispersion are absent in the current agreement. Therefore, I suggest adding the following language to Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates):

""Atlassian will evaluate the length and complexity of its subcontracting chains to ensure that they do not pose a risk to the security and confidentiality of Customer Data. Atlassian will identify the number of subcontractors in its chain and assess the risk associated with each subcontractor. Atlassian will also evaluate the geographical dispersion of its subcontractors and assess the risk associated with outsourcing to different regions. Atlassian will assess the complexity of its subcontracting chain and identify any potential vulnerabilities or risks. Atlassian will maintain written agreements with its subcontractors to ensure that they meet the requirements of this Agreement and will be responsible for their performance.""

By adding this requirement, Atlassian can ensure that it has a robust subcontracting chain management process in place to mitigate risks and protect Customer Data."
"Search for provisions assessing the provider's ability to monitor subcontracting chains. Extract details of tools or processes mentioned. If missing, recommend including monitoring mechanisms.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have identified provisions related to subcontracting chains, but they do not explicitly assess the provider's ability to monitor these chains. However, I have extracted some relevant details and recommendations for improvement:

**Provision:** Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. However, it does not specify any monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Agreement.

**Recommendation:** To address this gap, I suggest including a provision that requires Atlassian to implement monitoring mechanisms to oversee its subcontractors and Affiliates. This could include:

* Regular audits or assessments of subcontractors and Affiliates to ensure compliance with the Agreement.
* Requirements for subcontractors and Affiliates to maintain records and provide reports on their performance and compliance.
* Mechanisms for customers to report concerns or issues related to subcontractors and Affiliates.
* Procedures for Atlassian to investigate and address any non-compliance issues identified.

**Tools or processes:** While the Agreement does not mention specific tools or processes for monitoring subcontracting chains, I recommend considering the following:

* Implementing a subcontractor management system to track and monitor subcontractors and Affiliates.
* Utilizing audit and compliance tools to assess subcontractors' and Affiliates' performance and compliance.
* Establishing a clear and transparent reporting process for customers to report concerns or issues related to subcontractors and Affiliates.
* Developing a procedure for Atlassian to investigate and address non-compliance issues, including conducting regular reviews and assessments of subcontractors and Affiliates.

**Conclusion:** While the Atlassian Customer Agreement provides some provisions related to subcontracting chains, it lacks explicit requirements for monitoring these chains. To improve compliance and transparency, I recommend including monitoring mechanisms and tools to oversee subcontractors and Affiliates. This will help ensure that Atlassian's subcontracting chains are managed effectively and in accordance with the Agreement."
"Locate clauses ensuring transparency of subcontracting chains, including full disclosure of subcontractors. If absent, suggest adding transparency provisions.","Upon reviewing the Atlassian Customer Agreement, I have located clauses related to subcontracting, but they do not explicitly ensure transparency of subcontracting chains. Specifically, Section 20.11 (Subcontractors and Affiliates) states that Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under the Agreement, but it does not require Atlassian to disclose the names of its subcontractors or provide any information about the subcontracting chain.

To ensure transparency of subcontracting chains, I suggest adding a provision to the Agreement, such as:

""20.11. Subcontractors and Affiliates. Atlassian may use subcontractors or its Affiliates in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Atlassian will maintain a publicly available list of all subcontractors and Affiliates used in the performance of the Agreement, including their names, addresses, and contact information. Atlassian will also provide Customer with access to this list upon request.""

This provision would require Atlassian to disclose the names of its subcontractors and provide Customer with access to this information, ensuring transparency of the subcontracting chain."
